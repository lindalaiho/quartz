Computational studies on the topic [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016622369701120X) and [here](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpcell.00260.2001)

"The question is whether they [the paracrine interactions] serve a common purpose" [Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019) i.e. is there a universal theory that can be fit to understand the paracrine interactions?

#### Theory: self-regulation/autoregulation of the pituitary gland
Proposed e.g. by [Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019)

Could we call this [[Local homeostasis]]? The pituitary is truly essential for whole-body/"global" homeostasis but could these intrapituitary interactions mediate local homeostasis within the gland?

This might also happen through pituitary hormones themselves as has been shown for TSH: " we hypothesized that it would be more efficient for the fine-tuning of TSH secretion (_i.e._ to keep TSH plasma levels within a certain range) if the pituitary was able to measure and regulate its own TSH production, in analogy to modern heating boilers, which regulate their heat production through built-in temperature sensors in addition to the room thermostat." [Prummel 2000](https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.85.11.6991) - intrapituitary regulation might be more efficient than peripheral/brain signals?

To be able to self-regulate, cells need to know what's going on in neighbouring cells: "Islet cells also need to be made aware about the functional status of neighboring cells through paracrine interactions." [Caicedo 2013](https:///doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2012.09.007)

Implications:
- "renal autoregulation can dampen the effect of systemic hormones. Thus the overall renal effect of any systemic hormone can only be understood in the context of local paracrine signaling." [Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019)

#### Theory: redundancy to make the pituitary response robust to outside "threats"

#### Theory: cell-cell interactions in the pituitary form a "safety net" to allow continuing function
The term safety net was used by [Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019)

"Some endocrine cells, for example, insulin-producing cells, have redundant control mechanisms, presumably to protect against a failure with disastrous consequences" [Ben-Jonathan 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/1043-2760(92)90127-M)

#### Theory: paracrine regulation exists to coordinate function of the different axes
I.e. make sure that they play together well and support each other

#### Theory: pituitary cells as transducers of peripheral signals
Might it make sense to have one central cell type that responds to an external signal and mobilize a uniform short-term response in the pituitary rather than initiating an independent, potentially long-lasting response independently in each cell type?

#### Theory: intercellular communication exists to generate heterogeneity and therefore plasticity OR to maintain fidelity
If there was no regulation within the pituitary then all cells would be the same

"cells utilize optimal levels of paracrine signaling to maximize the accuracy of gradient-based positional information. Our results demonstrate the limits of population averaging and show the inherent tradeoff in utilizing paracrine communication to regulate cellular response fidelity" [here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09652.001)

Somehow network-based communication needs to average out signals but also maintain heterogeneity, same goes for paracrine signalling - how is that balance achieved? How does network/paracrine communication regulate cellular variability? Is that one aim of paracrine signalling - regulating heterogeneity to optimal levels? Keeping it in check to allow increased accuracy in collective responses? Does increased coordination always lead to reduced cellular variability (or vice versa)? Evidence that this happens [here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09652.001)

"Multicellular organisms utilize cellular diversity for specialization and division of labor. However, the variability between cells can be detrimental due to the potential loss of response fidelity. Paracrine communication can serve to share information between cells to regulate cellular variability [...] It is possible that paracrine information sharing is more prevalent in signaling networks that support individual cellular decisions and less prevalent in cases where biologically meaningful outcomes result from population averages [...] Paracrine averaging demonstrates how intercellular communication enables cellular collective decision making where the 'wisdom of the crowd' is greater than the individual cell. Theoretical and empirical work in humans and animal collectives has shown that the benefit of collective decision making depends on the size of the group; big crowds are not always better than small crowds. Therefore, it is likely that the extent of secretion of each paracrine ligand is adjusted to the level of cellular information sharing to ensure an effective collective decision." [here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09652.001)

#### Theory: the massive redundancy (explain) is the important part because it allows robustness
- There should be evidence in [this book](http://cognet.mit.edu.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/book/neuropeptides) that "The complexity of bioactive peptide signalling was first explained as a redundant and fail-safe system" (from [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200800055))
- Basically provides a buffering system against change, maybe it's especially important for pituitary function to remain stable because it secretes so many hormones that are essential to maintain survival etc.

#### Tentative theory: pituitary engages in self-regulation via cell-cell interactions instead of regeneration
[Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019) describe in introduction that the kidneys are massively active in urine filtering yet they have a modest capacity for *regeneration*. Isn't it kind of true that the (adult) pituitary also doesn't regenerate much (see evidence [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744558/) for discussion for and against) - so they are similar in this respect? The authors say that an alternative to regeneration is *self-regulation*. Are these really two separate things that achieve the same purpose? They say that "Instead of regeneration, the kidney meets highly variable demands with a solid repertoire for self-regulation and self-protection reflected in the numerous systems of local autocrine and paracrine signaling". Is regeneration, by analogy, the slit-och-släng way of doing whereas self-regulation is recycling? I.e. regeneration requires starting from scratch i.e. you make new functional cells and just replace the cells that start not being good enough whereas self-regulation means supporting the declining cells instead of replacing them? This requires plasticity! Which the pituitary is an expert in.
Melanotrophs don't change cell numbers to adapt to different coloured environments but instead "functionally interconvert" their cells [[Melanotrophs have a subpopulation of cells that store hormone]]

Most of new corticotrophs appear to come from progenitor differentiation rather than mitosis of existing corticotrophs *after adrenalectomy* [Nakane 1977](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1977.tb41854.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed). But [Langlais 2013](https://academic.oup.com/mend/article/27/7/1103/2615113?login=true) show that differentiated corticotrophs in the adult divide during "normal" conditions to replenish population (melanotrophs don't divide). Slow depletion of adult corticotrophs did not trigger progenitor replenishment even though ADX does this - authors suggest corticotroph network remodels to support fewer cells. It also seems that all corticotrophs have ability to enter the cell cycle rather than there being a small population that is responsible for division. Role of paracrine factors? NOTE: this suggests that different signals control activation of progenitors vs differentiated cells to make new corticotrophs.

Evidence:
- Self-duplication is the major contributor to postnatal expansion of corticotrophs [Langlais 2013](https://doi.org/10.1210/me.2012-1407)

The advantage of paracrine communication is that it is quickly initiated but also quickly terminated.

Paracrine interactions might be important to help pituitary cells cope with physiological challenges encountered by the animal that requires (rapidly) modified functioning by the pituitary to maintain appropriate activity (homeostasis)

####  Challenges

Some paracrine factors don't seem to have any effect on pituitary function [Morel 1989](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-124-4-1703) (although it could of course be that they are only employed during specific conditions)
