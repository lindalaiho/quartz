### Figures
- Make figure of each HP axis as a pipeline and then another one where you show all the overlap/crosstalk e.g. all pit cells respond to many hyp releasing factors https://www.pnas.org/content/94/25/14132.short, crosstalk within pituitary etc.
- We usually have a "vertical" view so hyp -> pit -> peripheral tissue instead of a "horizontal" view at each level i.e. cells within the pituitary or other organs affecting the output

#### Quotes
"*Extensive experimental evidence, unparalleled surgical and anatomical methodologies by Harris and others at the time, led to the firm establishment of the concept of median eminence-portal blood delivery of hypothalamic factors to the mammalian adenohypophysis. So dominant is this idea, that alternative views or data supporting a more complex form of hypothalamo-hypophysial communication in mammals has, to this day, been largely ignored by some sectors.*" [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475) <- evidence that the situation from 1984 hasn't improved much

"*We intend this review to emphasize **the idea that the anterior pituitary functions as a whole gland**, rather than a collection of independent secretory cells*" [Schwartz 1994](in papers folder)
