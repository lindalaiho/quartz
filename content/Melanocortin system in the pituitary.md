Pomc is massively expressed in the European eel pituitary (up to 30% of reads map to Pomc) and many of the post-translational processing modulators also [Ager-Wick 2013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077396)

Novel forms of post-translationally processed POMC peptides in medaka pituitary [Yasuda 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2011.08.016)

POMC(1-70), POMC(1-49) and POMC(1-26) inhibit PRL release [Schally 1991](https://www.pnas.org/content/88/9/3540.short)

a-MSH but not desacetyl-a-MSH increases the fraction of pituitary cells that release PRL [Ellerkmann 1992](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/131/2/566/2496231)

N-terminal POMC induced proliferation of lactotrophs (and no other cell types) in pituitary aggregates, antiserum raised against POMC(1-76) reduced lactotroph proliferation [Denef 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841398000206)

Other cell types, including gonadotrophs, express POMC [Denef 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841398000206)

Denef's reasoning for why the MCRs aren't mediating effects in the pituitary is that at least for the lactotroph proliferation inducing effects, the order of potency of ligands at MC3 in inducing cAMP is different from the order for proliferation inducing effects, also POMC(1-76) can't mobilise cAMP in HEK cells transfected with MC3. Antagonists to many of the MCRs also don't seem to fully block the Ca induction of POMC peptides [Denef 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841398000206). Could it be through other pathways than cAMP?

g3-MSH increases proliferation of somatotrophs and thyrotrophs (but no effect of POMC(1-76)) [Denef 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841398000206)

g3-MSH, g2-MSH, a-MSH, NDP-a-MSH increases iCa in GH3 cells [Langouche 2001](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/142/1/257/2988854?login=true)

POMC(1-76) and POMC(1-26) induced a rise in iCa in *immature* pituitary cells, 1/3 of cells were responsive to GHRP6 and small fraction to dopamine, suggesting that somatotrophs are among the cells involved [Denef 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841398000206)

Target cells of POMC(1-74) are overrepresented with cells expressing multiple hormone transcripts [Denef](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1440-1681.2001.03421.x)

N-POMC and ACTH(1-17) can enhance GH release and ACTH increase GH synthesis as well in bullfrog cells [Aida 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648099972891)
