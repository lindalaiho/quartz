[[The pituitary may first have been a paracrine gland]]

The hypothalamus and pituitary are present in all vertebrates from agnathans (jawless fishes) to mammals. These species exhibit 3 modes of communication between the hypothalamus and the pituitary [Sower 2015](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2015-1778):
1. Secretion of releasing hormones into the median eminence which travel through a portal system to the pituitary (**tetrapods**)
2. Direct innervation of the pituitary (**teleosts**)
	- However, [Golan 2015](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2015-1150) find that GnRH neuron boutons are connected with FSH cells (but not LH cells) in teleost pituitaries -> did neurohemal communication start with the gonadotrophs?
3. Diffusion of brain factors from the posterior to the anterior pituitary (**agnathans**) -> interesting!!! Is this the primordial way of communication?

The vertebrate pituitary may have evolved from a chemoreceptive structure in protochordates. In vertebrates, the sensory-receptive function has been transferred to the nervous system, allowing diversification of the secretory responses of the pituitary gland itself. Potential evidence for a chemoreceptive past of the pituitary may be found from the release of prolactin in response to osmotic changes [Gorbman 1995](https://doi.org/10.1006/gcen.1995.1016).
