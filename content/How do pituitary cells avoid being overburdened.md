 Inspired by discussion in [Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019) section V B.
 
 They propose that kidney cells must have some *inbuilt mechanism* to avoid being overburdened by requirements to do epithelial transport because otherwise they compromise the cell's own viability which is counterproductive.
 
 Is there something similar going on in pituitary cells? Especially since adult cells have limited regenerative capacity. Pituitary cells cannot secrete hormone at the expense of essential cellular maintenance. How do they make sure they don't expend resources on secretion at the expense of cellular viability?
 
 So is there some kind of signal system that uncouples/stops hormone production/secretion when pituitary cell integrity/basic functioning is jeopardized?
 
 This is especially relevant in terms of corticotrophs and chronic stress
 
 This very much relates to something [[Paul]] mentioned a while ago that the pituitary cell networks exist to dampen or somehow inhibit secretion
