### RETRACTION OF THEORY: [Duncan 2021](https://doi.org/10.1113/JP282367) already showed that there is no change in corticotroph capacitance, a measure of surface area, after chronic stress

Although [Sasaki 1990](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-127-1-285) showed that cold stress increased corticotroph areas by on average 21% vs no effect of novel environment stress

##### Theory inspiration
[Matovic 2020](https://doi.org/10.1113/JP280033) showed that after chronic stress CRH neurons had increased cell surface membrane area which was associated with the reduced excitability of CRH neurons. This was thought to be behind the habituation of the HPA axis during chronic stress.

#### QUESTION: are there changes to membrane surface area in corticotrophs during chronic stress and does this affect their excitability?

What could be driving this? Perhaps increased metabolic activity (related to [[Pituitary mitochondria]]) which might induce increased area? Would an increased area affect absorption from e.g. blood vessels? Note that adrenalectomy causes corticotrophs to increase their surface area with blood vessels [Kubba 1987](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02899203) [Itoh 2003](https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.10261)
