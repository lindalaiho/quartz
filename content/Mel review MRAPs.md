Concentration dependence of MRAPs on MC3 activity [frog paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcp.30306) - might be due to MRAPs forming oligomers [new MRAP paper](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(17)50456-1/fulltext)

Diff effects of MRAP2 on MC3 activity could be due to diff plasmid concentrations (see above) but also different cellular environment i.e. other interacting partners

Species-difference effects:
- Frog: no effect of MRAP or MRAP2 on a-MSH induced activation of MC3 only at ratio 1:6 for efficacy, no effects on EC50, increase of MRAP on MC3 EC50 in response to ACTH at all doses but only 1:6 for MRAP2. MRAP increases MC3 surface trafficking but only at dose 1:6 and MRAP2 inhibits MC3 surface trafficking at all doses. [frog paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcp.30306)
- Channel catfish: MRAP2 dose-dependently inhibits basal and a-MSH and ACTH stimulated MC3 cAMP signalling [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648018306701?via%3Dihub)
- Elephant shark: MRAP1 has no effect on MC3 signalling in response to ACTH or des-a-MSH, MRAP2 inhibits des-a-MSH induced MC3 signalling but no effect on ACTH [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648018304908?via%3Dihub)
- Human (Liang 2018): MRAP2 enhances efficacy of a-MSH stimulated MC3 signalling. MRAP2 reduces MC3 surface expression but also total MC3 abundance in the cell [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12020-018-1596-2)
- Chicken: MRAP and MRAP2 increase ACTH EC50 at MC3 but no effect on a-MSH. No effect of MRAP or MRAP2 on MC3 surface expression. [paper](https://joe.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/joe/234/2/JOE-17-0131.xml) in CHO cells
- Human (Kay 2013): MRAP increased a-MSH induced MC3 cAMP signalling. MC3 localises alone to cytoplasm and perinuclear region, also with MRAP
- Human (Chan 2009): no effect of MRAP or MRAP2 on MC3 surface expression. MRAP did not significantly inhibit MC3 signalling (although my eyeballs say decrease) in resp to NDP-a-MSH but MRAP2 did inhibit. Both seem to have additive effect.
- Mouse?? (Asai 2013 supplement): MRAP2 increases MC3 cAMP in response to a-MSH [paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6143/275.long), suppl in downloads

Seems that MRAP can modulate MC3 in all species studied to date but effects are inconsistent...

The use of different MC3 constructs? Interact diff with MRAPs
Studies using the S&T HA-tagged variant when studying MRAPs:
- [Kay 2013](https://jme.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/jme/50/2/203.xml)
- [Chan 2009](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/15/6146.long#sec-10)


PS evidence [here](https://jme.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/jme/50/2/217.xml) that MC3 undergoes PTM bc migrate at molecular mass diff than expected



PLAN

What are MRAPs
- Originally MC2 then shown to interact with all MCRs (Chan 2009)
- Antiparallel dimers
- Where expressed? Overlap with MCRs including MC3 indicates they might regulate MCR (and other receptor) function

Effects on MC
- Have been inconsistent
	- Describe
	- Despite MRAP/MRAP2 being v imp for MC2R trafficking (and signalling), the influence of MRAPs on trafficking of other MCRs is unclear
	- Put separately trafficking and then signalling/response to ligand
-  Why have they been inconsistent?
	- Dose/concentration dependence (obvious, have been suggested as reason, mention potentially bc oligomers formed)
	- Could also be cellular environment (CHO cells supposedly have no endogenous MRAP/MRAP2 expression says Chan 2009), evidence in support is that Kay and Chan used same receptor construct (what abt MRAP construct?) and saw diff eff in diff cell lines although could be ligand
	- Maybe: different MC3 construct used
	- Species - why so diff - is it true or due to methods (probs)


CLIPBOARD
"The recent finding that MRAP2 can form higher order oligomers likely corresponding to dimers, tetramers and octamers introduces the possibility that MRAP2 adopts different oligomerization states depending on the concentration of protein in a cell and the different MRAP2 conformations underlie the concentration dependent effects of MRAP2 on MC3 activity (Chen _et al._, 2020; Tai _et al._, 2021)."

"As melanocortinergic activity must be altered in response to a shift in physiological state, altering the cellular concentration of MRAPs could provide an additional way to regulate enhance or dampen melanocortin receptor signalling."

"Apart from the human, MRAP2 increased MC3 cAMP signalling in response to α-MSH in the mouse (Asai _et al._, 2013) and in response to ACTH but not α-MSH in the chicken (Zhang _et al._, 2017), whereas an inhibitory effect was found in the elephant shark in response to desacetyl-α-MSH but not to ACTH (Barney _et al._, 2019) and in channel catfish in response to both α-MSH and ACTH."

"In MDCK cells, MRAP2 translocated to the cell surface with the shorter variant but remained largely intracellular when co-expressed with the longer HA-tagged variant (Park _et al._, 2014)."

"The dimers appear to be constitutive (Chapman and Findlay, 2013; Cooray _et al._, 2011; Mandrika _et al._, 2005; Nickolls and Maki, 2006; Sánchez-Laorden _et al._, 2006), consistent with their formation prior to reaching the membrane, potentially in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sánchez-Laorden _et al._, 2006). Homodimerization of other GPCRs in the ER is important for proper folding and surface expression of the receptors (Angers _et al._, 2002)."

"While formation of MC1, MC3 and MC4 homodimers was uninfluenced by ligand binding (Mandrika _et al._, 2005; Nickolls and Maki, 2006), the extent of MC2 homodimerization can be enhanced by ACTH (Cooray _et al._, 2011). Differences in the signalling properties of monomers compared to dimers is still largely unknown, although has been suggested that interactions with MRAP may regulate the extent of melanocortin receptor homodimerization. MRAP did not influence MC2 homodimerization (but that other study?), whereas it decreased MC5 homodimerization (Sebag and Hinkle, 2009)."

Also homodimerisation could explain dom neg effects of known mutations in MC1 and MC4

Unknown what the ratio of homodimers to heterodimers to monomers to higher order oligomers… is and if it is regulated by interactions with other proteins in the cell
