### Intermediate lobe
Poorly vascularized in newborn and pubertal rats but more vascularized in adults [Murakami 1985](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.48.69) (also good pictures), also observed in [Murakami 1987](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.50.133)

The capillaries get thicker with age [Murakami 1985](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.48.69)
