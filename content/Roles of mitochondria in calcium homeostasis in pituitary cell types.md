### Background
For a long time it was thought that mitochondria only take in Ca if the cytoplasmic free Ca becomes dangerously high. This was thought to make sense since any role in Ca handling would take away from its primary function of generating ATP and since the ER was specialised to handle Ca. But then came evidence from several systems that mitochondria can take up Ca at physiological free cytoplasmic Ca concentrations [Kaftan 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M000903200)

### Gonadotrophs
How is Ca linked to gonadotropin secretion in gonadotrophs? [Kaftan 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M000903200)
- GnRH activates the GnRH receptor which increases IP3 in the cell
- IP3 releases Ca from ER stores
- Ca oscillations that reach high enough trigger FSH and LH secretion

Ca oscillations in the cell do not fully match a model that assumes two Ca compartments: the ER and cytosol [Kaftan 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M000903200)
- Cytoplasmic Ca clearance has been observed to have a strange multicomponent time course
- Cytoplasmic Ca clearance was faster than Ca reappearance in the ER (so it must have gone elsewhere than the cytoplasm & ER)
- Mitochondrial inhibitors seem to block Ca osciallations in response to GnRH

Effects of messing with mitochondria on Ca in gonadotrophs [Kaftan 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M000903200):
- Using the mito membrane potential collapser CCCP led to 
	(a) reduced frequency of Ca oscillations
	(b) slowed clearance of cytoplasmic Ca (mito account for 40% of the cytoplasmic Ca clearance)
	This was not due to reduced access to ATP in the cytoplasm since adding mito ATPase blocker changed nothing
- Note that there was significant [[Gonadotroph heterogeneity|heterogeneity]] in that in some gonadotrophs CCCP completely blocked Ca oscillations

Effects of GnRH on Ca presence in the mito [Kaftan 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M000903200)
- This can be done by Ca-sensitive dye rhod-2 which gets sequestered in the mito and you can use regular calcium green indicators that are in the cytoplasm to compare
- GnRH induced Ca oscillations in cytoplasm and Ca increased in the mito and remained elevated for minutes after cytoplasmic oscillations stop
- Why is Ca exit so slow from the mito?
	- Using a Na-Ca exchanger blocker the authors showed that the Ca leaves via this exchanger

### Somatotrophs
In goldfish somatotrophs, mitochondria contribute to basal GH secretion and to secretion evoked by salmon and chicken GnRH (strange...) [Johnson 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2005.02.003)
- Blocking mito Ca uptake via CCCP increases cytoplasmic Ca enough to evoke GH secretion basally
- The effects of mito blocking on GH release in response to salmon and chicken GnRH were different, suggesting that different pools of Ca were involved
