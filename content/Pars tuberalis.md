"In the course of human embryonic development the secretory differentiation of PT-specific cells precedes that of gland cells in PD and PI" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074769608601515, could it be that the PT directs differentiation of PD cells especially lactotrophs?

mRNAs for various pituitary hormones have been detected but not proteins ^2568a0

There may be species differences because the human PT does not express melatonin receptors [here](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/76/2/295/2651230?login=true)

Duality of thyrotrophs seems to be a general thing: PT thyrotrophs can be in one of two binary states reflecting long or short photoperiods and their relative proportion determines phasing

PT may influence corticotrophs via endocannabinoids https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00441-016-2544-1

Why do humans have a PT? If we argue that it's just a remnant then why is there no PT in snakes and only very few PT cells in lizards? [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475) section 7.2.1. And yet we don't (supposedly) have an intermediate lobe so why have we lost that but not the PT if neither has a purpose in humans? OK it could be that there simply was no evolutionary pressure to get rid of the PT whereas loss of the IL was important.

Note that if the mammalian AP is innervated then much of the evidence points to the PT being the part that is innervated (see conclusion in [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475))
