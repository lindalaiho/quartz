Is heterogeneity present under basal conditions or does it arise in response to a stimulus? I.e., how *stable* is the heterogeneity?

Heterogeneity on different scales - many studies find heterogeneity in terms of a small set of preselected markers or based on morphology whereas the global heterogeneity measured by scRNA-seq might miss some of those individual markers and be driven by artifactual things such as the dispersion (so again, does this heterogeneity arise in response to stimulus?)

How valuable is it to measure heterogeneity based on mRNA expression? I.e., is RNA abundance in any way relevant for the cell's phenotype? The nature of mRNA is to be unstable so you're much more likely to pick up on non-functionally relevant noise compared to heterogeneity based on protein (although RNA is probably not completely irrelevant for function)

Is there a many-to-one relationship between a cell's transcriptome and phenotype? As argued in [Eberwine 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2015.07.004)
- I.e. we have multiple combinations of transcriptome states that are functionally equivalent i.e. they map to the same phenotype
