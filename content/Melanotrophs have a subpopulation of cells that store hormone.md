Covered in [Gracia-Navarro 2002](https://doi.org/10.1076/apab.110.1.106.907), primary evidence largely from [Vazquez-Martinez 2001](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.142.7.8266)

a-MSH mediates skin darkening so animals adapted to dark environments need melanotrophs with high a-MSH secretion whereas animals living on light backgrounds need less a-MSH secretion

In light frogs, the authors found that there is a high-density subset of melanotrophs that have low secretory rates and low response to releasing factors. All animals have the same total number of cells and same apoptosis/proliferation rates and instead cells "interconvert functionally".
