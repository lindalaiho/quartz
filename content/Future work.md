[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0442-2) suggests a method to sequence physically interacting cells to gain info on cell-cell communication

[vertebrate paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/) suggests that during development, homotypic networks form before heterotypic ones. Could we look for CAM expression at e.g. E17.5 or whatever when gonadotrophs form to figure out which molecules might be involved?

Remodelling of these networks occurs e.g. lactotrophs in pregnancy and lactation - this presumably requires changes in CAMs - future work?

For my adhesion chapter, could I try to delete some of the candidate molecules ("knockout") or transfect e.g. corticotroph candidates into gonadotrophs ("knockin") and see what happens

How about we REVIVE the pituitary aggregates as models for communication?

Different species show different distribution of cell types in the pituitary. Does therefore cell-cell communication differ dramatically and might that contribute to species differences we see i.e. the contacts between cell types. Supported by big species differences in paracrine ligand expression in rats and mice, perhaps find evidence that pulsatility and other things to do with hormones are similar?

[Here](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/13/3/453/2548681) in the introduction is discussion of what evidence would be needed to show that a paracrine interaction exists

There is a need to fundamentally somehow unify all the knowledge on paracrine signalling, which perhaps could be done with systems biology approaches as suggested here https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200800055. This is so complex so likely to involve some kinds of mathematical modelling as has been applied to understanding neuronal signalling networks. Essentially, we are still stuck in reductionism in paracrine pituitary signalling in that we have elucidated individual interactions but now we need to put those findings back together
