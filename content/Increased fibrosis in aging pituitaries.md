The aging pituitary is not uniformly affected by fibrosis. The area by the pars intermedia and near the capsule are especially overcome by fibroblasts (this is in the human). Could this especially affect the cells localized there? [Greenberg 1975](https://doi.org/10.1093/geronj/30.5.531)

The pituitary network structure is probably disrupted by the extensive fibrosis

Author suggests that the pituitary vasculature probably drives the fibrosis. RBCs that escape from the vessels can accumulate in the tissue surrounding vessels and that eventually produces scarring and fibrosis. [Greenberg 1975](https://doi.org/10.1093/geronj/30.5.531)

**Potential functional significance**: "The fibrosis associated with blood vessels in the aged islet likely diminishes hormone [and paracrine factor?] diffusion through the interstitial space and disrupts hormone release into the circulation" [Almaca 2014](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1414053111)
