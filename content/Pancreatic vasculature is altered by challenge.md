### Pregnancy
Islet blood flow per weight of whole pancreas was higher in pregnant rats on day 15 of pregnancy and lower on day 18 [Svensson 2004](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.1800409)

### Diabetes
- Increased microvascular density, thickening and fragmentation of capillaries has been found in both humans [Brissova 2015](https://doi.org/10.1369%2F0022155415573324) and rodents [Mizuno 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(99)90107-5) with type 2 diabetes
- In rodent models, increased islet perfusion also appears to be a feature (but note that this was not necessarily associated with altered insulin secretion) [Jansson 1994](https://doi.org/10.1002/dmr.5610100405)
- Endothelial cell dysfunction has been proposed to underlie some of the vascular alterations (leading to dysfunctional beta cells) [Hogan 2016](https://doi.org/10.1002/dmr.5610100405)
