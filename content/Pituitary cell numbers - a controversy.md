### Evidence that proportions of pituitary cell types are very variable
- Lots of heterogeneity in humans
	- [Rasmussen 1929](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2007246/) (adult males)
	- [Rasmussen 1933](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2062714/) (adult females)
	- [Rasmussen 1950](https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1000860104) (children)

If cell type abundance varies a lot, how do the cells still form consistent [[Homotypic pituitary cell networks]] (also heterotypic)? Implications for [[Pituitary architecture]] in general

Evidence that corticotrophs make up between 2 and 15.5% of cells in [McNicol 1999](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009950308561)

[[Pituitary cell abundance is controlled by the hypothalamus]]
