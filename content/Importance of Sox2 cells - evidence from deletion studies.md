### Thoughts on [Roose 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16796-2)

Why do we not see any effects of the ablation: *They mostly deleted Sox2 cells in the marginal zone, what if the cells in the AP are the important ones?*
- Few Sox2+ve cells is enough to maintain function
	- Counterpoint: if the network structure of FS/stem cells is important, shouldn't it be disrupted if you get rid of even half the cells?
- Not all stem cells express Sox2
	- The paper notes that the cells in the anterior lobe have cytoplasmic Sox2 staining whereas the marginal zone Sox2 cells have nuclear staining - WHAT THE HECK does Sox2 do in the cytoplasm? Or is it just deciding not to translocate into the nucleus - waiting for signal to go there? There is evidence that PTMs e.g. acetylation makes it travel to the nucleus.
	- Sox2 ablation did not affect the number of cells expressing Sox2 in the cytoplasm which were mostly cells in the anterior lobe
	- The cSox2 cells did not proliferate after ablation in 1-week-old animals whereas the nSox2 cells did

Note that Sox2 cells reappeared in the stomach but not the pituitary so the pituitary really has very low proliferation

They've expressed everything relative to the total number of AP cells - but are we sure that the total n doesn't change with the treatment?

Also 5% of GH+ PRL+ cells of all pituitary cells in 1-week-old animals and 1%+ in adults :)

Am I getting this right for fig 4d: if you get rid of most Sox2 cells then they proliferate more in response to ADX than if you leave them intact? And same for ACTH Sox2 double positive cells? Doesn't this mean compensation since the total number of ACTH cells is not affected? So the small number of Sox2 cells is enough? So the leftover few numbers become more active and compensate?

Note that the DT/iDTR system kills cells (induce apoptosis) irrespective of their proliferation status

Their deletion for the ADX study did not reach 80% Sox2 cell deletion, more like 60%. So did they only present the "good" 80% results but in truth they get much more variability?

Two possible conclusions: (a) Sox2 cells are not important OR (b) a small number of Sox2 cells is sufficient to maintain function. My bet is on (b)!

The study also raises problematic implications about CRE. Since the cells with Sox2 protein in the cytoplasm were not hit by CreERT and hence were not ablated, there might be other cell types with this type of subpopulation bias where only one subgroup gets deleted


### What happens when you remove FS cells in reaggregates? [Tsukada 2016](https://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-16-0033)
- Methods: take S100b-GFP rat pituitaries, disperse the cells and create pools with/without GFP/FS cells by cell sorting
- Morphology: aggregates without FS cells have an irregular shape with non-smooth peripheral borders
- Features: absence of striated fibrillar collagen structure in the extracellular space, due to absence of type I and III collagens, fewer pericytes -> authors give evidence that FS cells signal to pericytes to stimulate collagen synthesis via TGFb2
