**Main conclusion:** "Our results reveal that aging of islets involves little intrinsic decline of beta cell function but is accompanied by malfunctioning blood vessels, suggesting that age-impaired glucose homeostasis is not caused by the intrinsic aging of beta cells but, rather, is a result of vascular aging that can be reversed by placing aged islets in a young environment."

**Findings:**
- Beta cells from old mice secrete more insulin in response to high glucose than beta cells from young mice, however no differences were found in human beta cells
- Islet area and the number of beta cells were higher in old vs young mice but no differences in humans
- Old mice are insulin resistant which they try to compensate for probably with the increased beta cell function but upon large glucose challenge the mice exhibit slower recovery
- No difference in blood vessel density (but [Chen 2021](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105242) saw major decrease in mice???)
- Old mouse and human islets contained 2x as many macrophages as young ones
- Blood vessels were inflamed and had fibrosis in old mice and human pancreata

Were the vascular defects due to systemic or local pancreatic influences?
- Test: transplant the islets into the iris where they are still exposed to systemic factors
- Confirm that the islets are functional when transplanted: old transplanted islets reverse diabetes just as well as young transplants
- Answer: something systemic from the young mice are able to rejuvenate the old islets so it's not something intrinsic to the islet that causes the vascular deterioration
- But why did it take longer for the older islets to reverse diabetes when they still produced more insulin? Bc they took longer to revascularise and the vessels were larger and less branched
