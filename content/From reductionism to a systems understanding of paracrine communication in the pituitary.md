So many paracrine factors have been identified in the pituitary and for some of those their functional influence has been studied. But this accumulation of factors that we know are important has not helped to understand, only increased "bewilderment" of what the "fundamental purpose" [Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019) of these paracrine interactions are.

We have so far been reductionstic and considered individual interactions. But they are very likely to interact and influence each other. As shown in [Evans 1999](https://doi.org/10.1210/edrv.20.1.0355):

Evidence for this can be found in [Ray 1997](https://doi.org/10.1210/edrv.18.2.0297):
- Provide unique signals to pituitary cells (e.g. EGF regulation of PRL)
- Provide signals that are overlapping with other types of signals (interleukin regulation of ACTH)
- Synergy with hypothalamic factors (e.g. FGF with TRH, LIF with CRH)
- Antagonise hypothalamic factors (IGF-I and GHRH)
- Interact with peripheral hormones to regulate pituitary function like gene expression (e.g. galanin and oestradiol)

The confusing this is that there appears to be great redundancy in what the paracrine interactions do.

"Our fascination with all the paracrine factors influencing the renal function often subsides into frustration over how difficult it is to acquire a proper overview of the entire system." [Leipziger 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00014.2019) -> this is where we need systems biology

"Animal cells use a conserved repertoire of intercellular signaling pathways to communicate with one another. These pathways are well-studied from a molecular point of view. However, we often lack an “operational” understanding that would allow us to use these pathways to rationally control cellular behaviors." [Antebi 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2016.12.003)

We lack a basic fundamental understanding beyond the identity of paracrine factors and their receptors. We have no idea whether it is e.g. absolute concentration or relative concentration of ligand that determines output and how the signal is processed and interpreted in a cell
