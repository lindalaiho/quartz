Evidence that factors can't diffuse freely within the gland

Blood flow may influence diffusion of paracrine factors "messengers suspended in interstitial fluid may be propelled from cell to cell (over a period of a few heart beats) by arterial pulsations via confluent perivascular spaces" [Gross 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323573)

"Hormone distribution from an intrapituitary depot is not uniform. Regions behind and lateral to such depots are influenced most extensively, while anteromedial hormone distribution appears to be greatly hampered, presumably by intrapituitary blood flow" [Bogdanove 1963](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-73-6-696)

"The asymmetrical and obviously variable shape of the area affected by the grafts or hormone pellets does not favor the idea of a merely passive diffusion gradient regulating the distribution of substances in the intercellular clefts of the adenohypophysis" [Krisch 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00214248)

What is responsible for this impeded spreading if tight junctions are leaky?

Is this a dynamic process i.e. cells regulate accessibility of substances? There is evidence from many other glands that tight junctions are actively regulated (for evidence see [Krisch 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00214248))

Isn't there evidence from other tissues that pellet implantation leads to much freer flow of substance compared to the pituitary?

### Evidence that pituitary cell function is gland location-dependent
- **Somatotrophs** from 8 different regions show different basal and GHRH stimulated GH release [Perez 1990](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-127-4-1877)
- **Lactotrophs** from medial parts of the PD respond differently than those from lateral parts [Nagy 1991](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-128-2-761), more striking regional differences also shown in [Mukherjee 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(91)90257-S)

Limiting food intake in rats causes highly regionalised changes in the pituitary where some parts of the anterior lobe are unchanged whereas other parts show marked changes. Upon refeeding, the recovery is also regionalised in that normal histology first reappears in the centre of the gland. [Jackson 1917](https://ia600708.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/28/items/crossref-pre-1923-scholarly-works/10.1002%252Faja.1000090101.zip&file=10.1002%252Faja.1000210204.pdf)

Prepro-CART mRNA distribution in the male rat pituitary shows a highly regionalised pattern [Stanley 2004](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00576.2003):

### Cellular distribution is regional during development
- At E18 in female rats, LHb +ve cells were most abundant in anterior and ventral regions of the gland, TSHb +ve cells were most abundant in the lateral wings [Schechter 1993](https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1001970202)
