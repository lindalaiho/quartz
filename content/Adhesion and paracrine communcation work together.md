### Evidence that pituitary structure is relevant to paracrine communication
- [Chronwall 1996](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02738871) found that calcitonin-IR cells were gonadotrophs in male and female pituitaries and that all these calcitonin+ve gonadotrophs were apposed to *cup-shaped* lactotrophs (but note that gonadotrophs in general have been described to selectively adhere to cup-shaped lactotrophs). In support of a functional relevance, calcitonin IR changed depending on physiological state (lactation, pregnant, OVX) and the extent of IR was inverse to prolactin status (the latter hormone content was not measured but inferred based on e.g. more prolactin in lactation and less in males).
