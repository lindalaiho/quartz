#### The sums argument
"Subtle shifts in the balance between positive and negative regulators may determine the function and fate" [Perez-Castro 2012](https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00003.2011)

Claims that single factors don't probably matter much [Boonen 2009](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.200800055) but I don't buy this because single factors can have major effects e.g. ATP can increase LH release 14-fold [Chen 1995](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.11.5219)

#### Some factors have a permissive/conditional/facilitatory role ("make the ground fertile for others to have their impact") whereas other have a direct modulatory role
Discussion here on such a theory as relevant for the brain: "Rather, they appear to fit better the designation of “biasing” or “enabling” (9, 10); the latter is an abstract term which I coined to indicate that the enabling transmitter (in this example, norepinephrine) can enhance or amplify the effectiveness of other transmitter actions received concurrently by convergent target neurons within the time domain of the enabling circuit’s activity" [Bloom 1985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1289631/)

This is very much linked to the theory that everything is context dependent i.e. you need a fertile ground for some effects to appear, not just for paracrine but also regarding peripheral hormones etc. [[Communication discussion#The effects of paracrine signalling are highly context-dependent]]
