### Evidence that networks may be important
- [[Adrenal networks|Gap junction coupling is increased between chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla during chronic stress]]
- Corticosterone impaired gap junction function in astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus by altering Cx43 expression, degradation and phosphorylation [Xia 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.12.003)
	- Interesting that effects of stress in brain and medulla appear to be the opposite: disrupt vs enhance connectivity
	- It appears that antidepressants alter gap junctions in the brain
