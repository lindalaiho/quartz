[Ballian 2007](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-006-0719-8) describe 3 different models of islet perfusion:
1. Blood flows from non-beta cells towards beta cells
	- In e.g. mice and rats where beta cells are situated in the core of the islet and non-beta cells exist in the mantle surrounding the core, there is evidence that blood flows from the periphery to the centre of the islet
	- In animals e.g. horses and monkeys where the cell type arrangement is the reverse (i.e. beta cells in the periphery and non-beta cells in the middle), there is evidence for core-to-mantle blood flow
	- Implication: secretory products from non-beta cells regulate beta cell function
2. Blood flows into the core via 1-3 arterioles, bypassing the mantle, then diffuses through capillaries from the core to the mantle and then to the exocrine pancreas
	- There is particular support for this model in human islets that have a less clear cell type arrangement (but also in e.g. rats)
	- There is evidence that order of perfusion is beta -> alpha -> delta cells
3. Blood enters the islet from one side via a feeding arteriole and then perfuses throughout the islet before entering the other side
	- In this model, there is no preferential (order of) perfusion of any cell type
	- This is the only model consistent with the inhibitory effects of SST on beta cells being mediated by the microvasculature
