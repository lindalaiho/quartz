What are the important assumptions of the model?
- The center of HPA ultradian pulsatility is located in pituitary
- Glucocorticoids don't affect CRH secretion (hmmmm...)
- There is a time delay from ACTH secretion to CORT secretion
- GR dynamics don't matter in the pituitary for pulsatility (hmmmm...)
- The corticotroph membrane electrical potential controls the amount of released ACTH

What did they find?
- The time delay between ACTH secretion and CORT secretion is not critical for pulsatility -> the pulsatility is upstream and independent of the adrenals

My issues with the paper:
- There is no negative control - i.e. just bc this model is consistent with experimental data doesn't mean that no other model is (e.g. one that includes the hypothalamus)
- Some of the assumptions seem quite problematic (note my hmmmmm....'s). Particularly the irrelevance of GR in both the hypothalamus and the pituitary.

### Androgen receptors might alter HPA axis activity at the level of the pituitary
- *Male* (but not female) AR KOs have elevated serum ACTH and corticosterone
- Male AR KOs have decreased GR mRNA and protein and increased Pomc mRNA (no change in GR the PVN), there is an androgen response element in the intron between exons 1A and 1B of the GR gene [Miyamoto 2007](https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.02039-06)
