[GÃ¶ngrich 2016](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2016.00065) showed that Cx36 is expressed in the pituitary (gonadotrophs only) and not in other parts of the HPG axis. mRNA expression of Cx36 in the pituitary was similar in both sexes but Cx36 KO affected LH and oestradiol levels in female mice but no effect on hormones in males. OVX doubled Cx36 expression but castration males had no effect. In pituitary slices from WT females, GnRH produced an increased number of cell pairs with enhanced synchrony but this did not happen in pituitary slices from KO females.
