### Why is the IL avascular?
[Tanaka 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.01.009) made transgenic frogs that express a GFP-VEGFA fusion protein in melanotrophs to show that VEGFA expression drives vascularisation
- The transgenic frogs had higher POMC expression in the IL compared to WT but had less a-MSH expression which might have been caused by the lower PC2 expression observed
- Increased VEGFA and angiogenesis in the IL also correlated with fewer dopaminergic neurons in the IL
- CONCLUSION: this all supports that the vasculature plays an active role in shaping endocrine cell function




### Lack of vascular contact for  melanotrophs vs contact for corticotrophs could be used to figure out how corticotrophs form contacts with the blood vessels
