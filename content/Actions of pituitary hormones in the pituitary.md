### GH
- [Fraser 1992](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.130.6.1597156) showed that GH receptor mRNA, immunoreactivity and GH binding sites are present in rat and rabbit anterior pituitaries, in somatotrophs and non-somatotrophs (also in the nuclei)

### Prolactin
- 125I-prolactin gets internalised by rat lactotrophs into the nucleus, golgi and mitochondria [Giss 1985](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(85)90057-7)
