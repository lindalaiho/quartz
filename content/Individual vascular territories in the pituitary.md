Evidence
- Discussion in [Krisch 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00214248)
- Complete or partial resection of the pituitary stalk causes bilateral vs unilateral "infarction" of the PD [Adams 1964](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-75-1-120) suggesting that certain portal vessels supply certain parts of the gland, more varied regional "infarctions" seen in [Daniel 1956](https://doi.org/10.1113/expphysiol.1956.sp001184)
- Resin injections into the aorta and making of resulting vascular casts reveal vessels in some parts of the PD but parts of the PD remain unfilled at certain resin concentrations [Murakami 1993](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.56.243) fig. 10 asterisk
- Fig 22 in [Murakami 1987](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.50.133)
- "it should be noted that a solution infused into a portal vessel usually does not distribute evenly throughout all the sinusoids of the anterior pituitary" [Porter 1973](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-571129-6.50008-7) (citation from some conference proceedings I can't access)
- Oestrogen pellets placed in the pituitary only causes local effects on gonadotrophs [Bogdanove 1963](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-73-6-696) "Hormone distribution from an intrapituitary depot is not uniform. Regions behind and lateral to such depots are influenced most extensively, while anteromedial hormone distribution appears to be greatly hampered, presumably by intrapituitary blood flow"
- "Near the grafts the reaction was strongly inhibited, whereas remote pituitary regions were so unaffected they could serve as intrinsic controls" (refers to thyroid autotransplants) [Bogdanove 1961](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-69-3-581) "The (predominantly unilateral) pituitaiy grafts exhibited sharply limited, concentric zones of effect, so that peripheral pituitary regions—particularly the contralateral anterior lobes—could serve as intrinsic controls" "The affected zones were not spherical. They extended least far anteriorly and reached farthest posteriorly (perhaps also laterally)" -> diffusion is differently possible in different parts of the pituitary "These observations suggest that the anterior part of the hypophysis would be the most effective graft site, and this appears to be true (Fig. 2A). Even, very large grafts in the posterior part of the gland (Fig. 1C) had surprisingly slight effects." "this direct effect may be hindered considerably because of rapid removal of the TH by the pituitary circulation, which sweeps it caudally so that it influences primarily the regions behind the graft" -> so paracrine/other factors are more likely to be secreted from cells "upstream"?
- Cells from different parts of the gland have different function [[Regionality in the pituitary]]

All of this is only possible if there are some kind of territorial delimiters in the pituitary because blood vessels are fenestrated

Could this underly the differential release/functionality of hormone from cells from different parts of the gland?

Rates of blood flow are different in the medial (higher flow) vs lateral (lower flow) parts of the PD [Kemeny 1985](https://doi.org/10.3171/jns.1985.63.1.0116)

DA concentration in medial portal vessels is higher than lateral vessels, as well as the rate of collection of DA from those vessels (not due to different blood flow bc rate was lower laterally) (specific bc no difference in NA or adrenaline)

### Observations
Anterior pituitary capillaries are about twice as wide as capillaries in some other organs, mostly brain [Gross 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323573) Table 1 (OK it could just be that endocrine organs in general have wider capillaries)

### Questions
Does e.g. GHRH induce altered blood flow only in certain parts of the gland if it arrives via specific portal vessels?

What limits the flow of blood from the non-infarcted to the infarcted areas of the PD?

When you completely transect the pituitary stalk and supposedly cut all blood flow to the pituitary, why is there always a part of the peripheral pituitary that does not become "infarcted"? Quite clearly evidence for regional blood supply ^37095a

Same happens when you only partially transect the stalk

As we discussed with [[Paul]], it is also relevant to consider the *order in which pituitary cells are perfused*. Cells near the veins that collect pituitary hormones can secrete the hormone and then cells "upstream" where the blood enters the pituitary are then exposed to systemic, lower levels of the hormone so the hormone could potentially act as a paracrine regulator.
