Question: why do pituitary cells receive inputs from so many different places if hypothalamic input is the only thing that matters? The other things also probably regulate pituitary function.

The pituitary really is a "hub" or centre or meeting ground or *all roads lead to the pituitary*

Different inputs to the pituitary
- Hypothalamic factors released into the portal vessels (classical)
- Non-hypothalamic originating i.e. local factors released from the median eminence
- Potential direct innervation (for review of evidence see [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475) towards the end)
- Autocrine
- Paracrine from other cells (also PT and intermediate lobe)
- Paracrine from cells lining blood vessels
- Juxtacrine communication
- Gap junction-mediated communication
- Factors from basal lamina/ECM
- Peripheral factors via blood
- Potential factors from the posterior pituitary
