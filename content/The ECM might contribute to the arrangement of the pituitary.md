[Winklbauer 2019](https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.231597) shows that adhesion strengths measured experimentally are too high to be created by CAM-to-CAM adhesion and that a stronger type of adhesion could be created by adhesion to the pericellular matrix. If we were able to measure the adhesion strengths bw pituitary cells could we rule out if CAMs are capable of creating the adhesions themselves? Limitation: author only included adhesion strengths for typical CAMs like cadherins
