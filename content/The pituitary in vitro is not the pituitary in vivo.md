[Rivier 1983](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-113-3-939) show that the interaction between CRH and AVP is much more complex in vivo than in vitro (supposedly supporting that AVP is a much more potent secretagogue in vivo than in vitro). More discussion on p. 79 in [Schwartz 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(90)90179-C) showing that AVP and CRH seem to differ hugely in their effects on ACTH secretion even in the same species and same lab

### Pituitary cells in culture show different expression of pituitary hormones
- Double-positive Fsh and Lh gonadotrophs were more abundant in medaka pituitary cell culture after GnRH treatment than in vivo (where GnRH is present) [Fontaine 2020](https://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-19-0405)
- Medaka pituitary Fsh mRNA expression disappears almost completely after 24h of culture (while Lh mRNA decrease is much more modest and not significant) [Fontaine 2020](https://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-19-0405)

### Pituitary cells in culture respond differently
- Medaka FSH+ve gonadotrophs cultured for 72h begin to show iCa responses to GnRH despite being known not to respond to GnRH in vivo (yet GnRH receptor expression didn't change) [Fontaine 2020](https://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-19-0405)
