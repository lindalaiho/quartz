Description of gonadotroph physical associations with other cell types in viscachas (rodent), associations vary with photoperiod. They also noted that the corticotrophs in association with gonadotrophs were more irregular in shape. [Filippa 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040816612000614)

In the rat, 14% of gonadotrophs form associations with corticotrophs and 18% of corticotrophs form associations with gonadotrophs, FS cells appear to form most associations with gonadotrophs [here](https://oce.ovid.com/article/00129039-199906000-00007/HTML) - but is the problem with this quantification that these are 2D images and therefore they seem to be less connected vis Patrice?

Low affinity/attachment between cort and gon here as well (2-3% of surface area in contact)

Observation of various tight and adherens junctions as well as bridge-like connections in pituitary reaggregates [Van der Schueren 1982](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/110/2/513/2590926)
