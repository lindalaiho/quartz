Structure:
- Describe how the pituitary is regulated by (a) hypothalamic input and (b) peripheral humoral input

Evidence that pituitary cells are organized randomly, which speaks against any local organization within the pituitary [Fauquier 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1043-2760(02)00616-1)

It was thought to be okay to study cell types removed from their local context because they are only regulated from the outside [Perez 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(95)03575-R)

### Evidence that endocrine glands are regulated from the outside
- "The classical image of the endocrine system is that secretory function of a gland is regulated from outside that gland by other organs" [Vankelecom 1998](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19971015)39%3A2%3C150%3A%3AAID-JEMT6%3E3.0.CO%3B2-P)
- "A classical concept of the endocrine system assigns to outside organs the regulation of its secretory activity" [Luc√≠a 2000](https://doi.org/10.1007/s007950000023)
