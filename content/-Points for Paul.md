The saying "cells that fire together wire together" - could it apply to other systems as well like the pituitary? So it's like networks being required for secretion but could it also be the other way around? That cells that secrete in a synchronised manner become more closely associated?

Inhibiting ABCB1, the protein found by Lopez to define a population of ZF cells that increased after chronic stress, reduces mitochondrial ATP production https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23071-6 also they may mediate ATP secretion from cells (as in extracellular ATP the signalling molecule) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720709002743

"Some endocrine cells, for example, insulin-producing cells, have redundant control mechanisms, presumably to protect against a failure with disastrous consequences. Lactotrophs, on the other hand, are excessively regulated without fulfilling an indispensable physiologic function for the individual itself." [Ben-Jonathan 1992](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/science/article/pii/104327609290127M) could it be that lactotrophs are important intrapituitary regulator centres? And that's why there are so many of them as they support other pituitary cells? Even if peripherally they might not always be so important

Is there a correlation between importance of paracrine regulation and peripheral regulation? I.e. lactotrophs are not controlled by peripheral feedback like e.g. corticotrophs and gonadotrophs so is paracrine more important for them? Would paracrine "compensate" for the lack of peripheral feedback?

"Whereas the intermediate lobe is prominent in the fetus, it is not distinct in adults. Apparently, the intermediate lobe regresses after birth and the melanotrophs migrate to both the anterior and neural lobes. We speculate that PRF-producing cells also migrate to the anterior pituitary." [here](https://www.cell.com/trends/endocrinology-metabolism/comments/1043-2760(92)90127-M)

Folliculostellate cell numbers change inversely with corticotrophs with aging and chronic stress [here](https://vestnikramn.spr-journal.ru/jour/article/view/129)

If the cells in pituitary scRNA-seq data actually express several transcripts instead of them forming by cells taking up expelled transcripts from other cells then shouldn't we see differential proportions in doublets vs single cells? Doublets are supposedly not well-dissociated and could they therefore be expected to have less "fake" transcripts?

Interestingly Sox2 has 3 thyroid hormone receptor alpha response elements in its enhancer and it appears that T3 represses Sox2 expression. Thrb is upregulated 0.74 log2fold in control vs d21 in the snRNA-seq dataset but not significantly - this would be consistent with disappearance of T3 and so also its receptor which may lead to increased Sox2 but that we don't really see...

[Armstrong 1998](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F002215549804600807) found that at least 2 of the pituitary cell types won't respond to secretagogues without BSA in the medium

Evidence that dispersal induces IEGs? [Armstrong 1998](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F002215549804600807) found that of female rat pituitary cells dispersed for 1h and plated for 1h, 26.3% of the cells expressed fos proteins. 30 min incubation in medium alone already activated c-fos transcription.
