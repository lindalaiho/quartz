### Evidence for the accumulation of factors in/at the nucleus
- GH
	- iv injected 125-I labelled bovine GH translocated to the nuclear matrix in rat hepatocytes and this translocation was not dependent on the cytoskeleton [Lobie 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(17)31966-X)
	- In stably transfected CHO cells GH and GH receptors concentrate into caveolae (plasma membrane microdomains) and GH is internalised in caveolae-containing vesicles bc distupting these with sterol-binding agents partially inhibits 125-I GH internalisation [Lobie 1999](https://doi.org/10.1006/excr.1998.4288)
- Prolactin
	- 125I-prolactin gets internalised by rat lactotrophs into the nucleus [Giss 1985](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(85)90057-7)
	- Contrasting evidence: no nuclear localisation of prolactin or the prolactin receptor in transfected cells [Perrot-Applanat 1997](https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.110.9.1123)
- Substance P
	- SP IR has been observed in the nucleus (in the euchromatin, near the heterochromatin) of rat gonadotrophs and lactotrophs [Morel 1982](https://doi.org/10.1159/000123360)
- Calcitonin
	- Calcitonin IR is found in rat lactotrophs in the nucleus (primarily in the euchromatin near heterochromatin) [Morel 1989](https://doi.org/10.1530/acta.0.1200682)
- GnRH
	- GnRH binds to the nuclear membrane with similar properties as the plasma membrane binding sites in purified nuclei from the rat anterior pituitary (note that this was specific binding since GnRH did not bind liver nuclei) and this binding is regulated by the stage of the oestrus cycle [Millar 1983](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(83)80648-6)
	- The primate GnRHR is an atypical GPCR in that it does not have a long C-tail and it is poorly expressed at the plasma membrane. [Re 2010](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011489) used human cell lines transfected with the receptor to show that a large proportion of the receptor pool was located at the nuclear membrane and had a functional role at the nuclear membrane, namely altering histone H3 acetylation and phosphorylation.
- Atrial natriuretic peptide
	- ANP immunoreactivity has been observed in rat gonadotrophs, corticotrophs and lactotrophs in the nucleus (weak staining) [Morel 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(88)90137-2)

### Evidence for the accumulation of factors in extranuclear locations
- Mitochondria
	- In CHO cells transfected with the GH receptor, GH can localise to mitochondria and stimulate cellular oxygen consumption [Perret-Vivancos 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.027)
	- Rats injected with 125I-GH accumulated the ligand in liver cells (this was selective since e.g. GHRH did not localise there) and in isolated mitochondria GH inhibited (in opposition to the effect in whole cells) specific respiration complex enzymes (note that bc these were isolated the effects could not be mediated by GHR at the membrane) [Adrail 2010](https://doi.org/10.1159/000268289)
	- 125I-prolactin is localised in the nucleus and mitochondria in rat lactotrophs [Giss 1985](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(85)90057-7)
	- ANP immunoreactivity has been found in gonadotrophs, corticotrophs and lactotrophs in the mitochondria [Morel 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(88)90137-2)

### What do these factors do inside the cell?
Regulate gene expression
- Nuclear GH receptor presence in the liver is strongly correlated with proliferative status in vivo [Conway-Campbell 2007](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0600181104)
