# Evidence for heterogeneity in rodent corticotrophs

### Morphological heterogeneity
![[Pasted image 20220527130836.png]]
- 4 types of corticotrophs according to [Childs 1987](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb24965.x) (figure)
- Basal corticotroph cell volumes and areas are very heterogeneous, volumes vary from 500 to 1800 µm3 and surface areas from 350 to1100 µm2 in adult male rats [Taniguchi 1992](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00319374)
- [Childs 1990](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-126-4-1967) identified distinct small and large male rat corticotrophs in culture which exhibited different CRH binding profiles. Large corticotrophs pre-treated with AVP for 1h showed increased CRH binding (as in more cells bound CRH) whereas AVP pre-treatment did not affect CRH binding of the small corticotrophs.
- [Kurosumi 1984](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.47.279) identified 2 types of corticotrophs in male rat pituitaries based on their morphology: "typical" and "atypical".
	- Typical corticotrophs: star-like shape, many slender projections (mostly towards capillaries), secretory granules arranged in a single row along the plasma membrane, more frequent than the atypical corticotrophs, frequently apposed to somatotrophs
	- Atypical corticotrophs: elliptical/polyhedral shape, have fewer projections which are also shorter and thicker, secretory granules are more abundant and distributed throughout the cytoplasm
	- The authors also found some corticotrophs with intermediate characteristics of the 2 types
- Cells in the male rat pituitary that stain with anti-porcine ACTH(1-39) sera can be divided into 4 types with distinct ultrastructural profiles [Yoshimura 1981](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00210144)
	- Large stellate corticotrophs: have secretory granules arranged in a peripheral row along the plasma membrane, most frequent type, often embrace acidophils with projections
	- Elongate/spindle-shaped corticotrophs: rare, smaller than the first type, never embrace acidophils, secretory granules are either arranged along the plasma membrane or densely packed in the cytoplasm
	- Polygonal/oval corticotrophs: rare, have very small secretory granules, large mitochondria
	- Stellate corticotrophs: rare, large size (same as first type), secretory granules have very variable size
- Heterogeneity in terms of blood vessel proximity: out of 20 corticotrophs identified in a 3D reconstruction of the male rat pituitary, 13 were directly apposed to a blood vessel, whereas 7 were not in contact with any vessels [Yoshitomi 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep36019)

### Heterogeneity in terms of Pomc expression or stimulated ACTH secretion
- [Hatfield 1989](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-124-3-1359) found highly variable Pomc mRNA expression (ISH) in dispersed rat pituitary cells
- Female rat corticotrophs in culture immediately after dispersion produced 100-fold variable plaque areas in response to 10^-7 M CRH (bimodal distribution) vs unstimulated plaque areas that were unimodal. The CRH-responsive subpopulation (high secretors) was preferentially inhibited by glucocortiocoids. [Neill 1987](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-571143-2.50011-3)
- Of dissociated female rat pituitary cells in culture, 4.85% formed ACTH plaques in response to CRH, 3.44% formed plaques in response to AVP and CRH + AVP caused 5.80% of cells to form plaques. They found evidence from double RHPA assays that there were cells that responded to both CRH and AVP and cells that responded to CRH but not AVP but no cells responded to AVP and not to CRH (this is in contrast to other studies mentioned in the discussion which found same number of corticotrophs responding to CRH and AVP and cells responding to AVP but not CRH). Note that some of these formed plaques only when both CRH and AVP were present. [Jia 1991](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-128-1-197)

### Subsets of corticotrophs express other pituitary hormones
- [Childs 1982](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-110-5-1676) showed that the proportion of corticotrophs co-storing FSH/LH changes from P2 to adult rats, varying from 93% (P11) to 44% (adults). Note that IR for the hormones were in different parts of the cell.
- Evidence for co-expression of mRNA for POMC with mRNA for GH/PRL and/or a-GSU which changes across development (E16, P1 or P38) in mouse pituitaries [Seuntjens 2002](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2826.2002.00808.x)
- In pituitaries from control male rats, 1.5% of cells were positive for antisera to both ACTH and TSH and this rose to 4.8% after AVP treatment (1h, 10 nM) in vitro [Childs 1989](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-125-1-554)
- At birth, a large proportion of rat corticotrophs (determined as cells that express Pomc mRNA) also express alpha-GSU mRNA. This proportion declines to almost nothing as the animals reach adulthood. However, when pituitary cell reaggregates from P14 rats are treated with CRH, the % of Pomc mRNA +ve cells that also express alpha-GSU go up from virtually nothing to 29.1%. However, there was very little colocalisation of ACTH and alpha-GSU protein. [Pals 2006](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2006-0685)

### Subsets of corticotrophs express non-ACTH factors
- [Tanaka 1986](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00251036) identified 3 types of corticotrophs in adult female rats based on their a-MSH content. These correlated with the different morphological types of corticotrophs (stellate/typical = little MSH, polygonal/atypical = MSH in almost all granules, and intermedate/transitionary = MSH in most granules but there were few granules in total (MSH and ACTH did not co-exist in granules))
- [Childs 1988](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-123-6-2885) were able to separate male rat corticotrophs from other pituitary cells using counterflow centrifugation and found that 60% stored ACTH only, 30% stored ACTH and beta-endorphin (and 10% stored beta-endorphin only). 
- 51% of dispersed male rat corticotrophs were immunoreactive against gastrin releasing peptide (but note that the extent of staining in the pituitary was variable depending on the antiserum used) [Houben 1991](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-128-6-3208)
- Galanin-containing corticotrophs increased from ~17% at E16 to ~27% at E21 in female rats [Cimini 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0196-9781(00)00321-1). In adult female rats, 50-70% of corticotrophs were immunoreactive to galanin. Almost all female rat corticotrophs became immunoreactive to galanin upon ADX. [Cimini 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323579)
- mRNA distribution of different proprotein convertases is heterogeneous across the male rat corticotroph population (identified by Pomc ISH), how these overlapped is unclear (fig below) [Dong 2002](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.143.1.8570)
![[m_ee0128570003.jpeg]]
- 38% of male rat corticotrophs were positive for SSTR5 mRNA (ISH) and 2-3% were positive for SSTR2 mRNA [Day 1995](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.136.11.7588263)
- Of female rat corticotrophs, 35% expressed mRNA (ISH) for ERalpha and 25% expressed mRNA for ERbeta [Mitchner 1998](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.139.9.6181)
- Angiotensin II receptor 1B mRNA (ISH) was present in 21.5% of male rat corticotrophs [Lenkei 1999](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.140.1.6397)
- Of female rat corticotrophs (from metestrus animals), 9.9% stained for EGFR [Armstrong 1997](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.138.5.5118)  
- 30-40% of male rat corticotrophs stain for IL-2 receptor protein [Artz 1995](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02990062)
- NGF is expressed in less than 10% of male rat corticotrophs but about 1/3 of corticotrophs expressed gp140-trkA (a high-affinity NGF receptor) [Patterson 1994](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7925133/)
- CRH type 1 receptor-like immunoreactivity was present in 27.1% of male corticotrophs and 18.0% of female corticotrophs in rats [Mano-Otagiri 2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/jne.12440)
- A subpopulation of corticotrophs in male rats contained mRNA for prepro-CART [Stanley 2004](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00576.2003)
- A subpopulation of rat corticotrophs was immunoreactive to glucokinase [Sorenson 2007](https://doi.org/10.1369%2Fjhc.6A7117.2007)
- A subpopulation of rat corticotrophs was immunoreactive for growth hormone binding protein [Harvey 1993](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.133.3.8396011)

### Corticotrophs exhibit heterogeneous IEG responses
- Male rat corticotrophs showed c-Fos IR in response to iv CRH (no dose-response) and even more in response to acute stress. "The proportion of c-Fos-expressing cells to corticotrophs was about 2:3" (this is in response to CRH). [Takigami 2007](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-007-0547-7)
- At basal in diestrus female rats, 7.6% of all pituitary cells co-stain for c-fos and ACTH, suggesting that a subset of corticotrophs express c-fos [Armstrong 1997](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F002215549704500603). A proportion of dissociated proestrus female rat corticotrophs responded to GnRH and EGF by increasing c-fos (protein) expression [Armstrong 1998](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F002215549804600807)

### Subsets of corticotrophs respond differently to various intra- and extrapituitary factors
- [Vigh 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0196-9781(93)90011-5) found that 50% of corticotrophs from female rats responded to biotin-labelled PACAP
- 34% of an enriched population of male rat corticotrophs responded to EGF by taking up BrdU (up from 18% at basal) [Childs 1995](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.136.4.7895669)
- 2.1% of dissociated male mouse corticotrophs incorporated Brdu in response to IGF-1 (up from 0.86% at basal) [Oomizu 1998](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.1570053). Related: a proportion of female mouse corticotrophs was found to be positive for IGF-1 receptor mRNA [Honda 1998](https://doi.org/10.2108/0289-0003(1998)15[573:IGFAIR]2.0.CO;2).
- By measuring iCa responses (cells loaded with fura-2) to different hypothalamic secretagogues in male rat pituitaries, different proportions of corticotrophs were found to be responsive to various combinations of the secretagogues (see their Table 1) [Villalobos 1997](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.25.14132)
- Male rat corticotroph iCa responses to combined CRH and AVP (3 min) in primary culture can be divided into types based on how they returned to baseline after the stimulus. Responses were also heterogeneous to either secretagogue alone. Corticotrophs responded differently to glucocorticoid inhibition. Basal Ca activity was also variable in the corticotroph population. [Romano 2017](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2017-00107)
- At basal, 8.4% of P14 female rat corticotrophs showed [3H]T labelling and this increased 11.4% with GnRH treatment, suggesting that a proportion of corticotrophs were GnRH-responsive (this was suggested to be due to a paracrine factor secreted from gonadotrophs since gonadotroph-conditioned medium could mimic the effect. Very interestingly, the effect could only be observed in the absence of the neurointermediate lobe in culture.) [Tilemans 1992](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.130.2.1310281)
- NGF treatment recruited a proportion of reaggregated P14 female rat corticotrophs to incorporate [3H]T (at basal ~6% of corticotrophs incorporate [3H]T and this is up 44% with NGF treatment) [Proesmans 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(97)00175-5)
- Mathematical modelling suggests that various ion channel currents (I-Nab, I-Kir, I-K,leak, I-BK) underlie the heterogeneous Ca responses observed in corticotrophs [Fletcher 2017](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00948.2016)

### Random thoughts
- Evidence that corticotrophs are an especially (morphologically) heterogeneous cell type: for the longest time (until ACTH staining was available) scientists couldn't agree on the identity of corticotrophs in the pituitary (often misidentified with thyrotrophs etc.). Discussed in [Moriarty 1973](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F21.10.855).
- Some of the heterogeneity is present at basal but much of it seems to appear in response to a stimulus - issue of stable vs inducible heterogeneity. Would we expect the latter to be more reproducible? E.g. gradation of response as suggested by [Childs 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1043-2760(05)80007-4):  "The more severe cold stress increased POMC mRNA and granulation in most corticotropes. The less severe exposure to novel environment caused these changes in only a subset of cells. This may indicate that subsets of corticotropes are in different states of readiness for a specific response."
- But is this reported heterogeneity an artifact of culture since most studies are performed in vitro?
- Problem: what's the definition of a corticotroph? Usually anything that makes ACTH is a corticotroph. But many heavily degranulated corticotrophs won't be positive for ACTH and some non-corticotrophs (multihormonal cells) make ACTH...
- What is the relationship between these all different "types" of corticotrophs identified in the literature? Are some of them the same or is the heterogeneity a spectrum?
- If some of the subpopulations overlap, the interesting question is really WHY?
- It appears that human corticotrophs exhibit significantly different morphology/size/secretory granule distribution from rat/mouse corticotrophs [Tsumuraya 1982](https://doi.org/10.1530/acta.0.1010484)
