### Why is the pituitary a complex system?
- "it is difficult to derive their collective behavior from a knowledge of the systemâ€™s components" [Barabasi 2016](http://networksciencebook.com/)

### Research ideas
[[Predict most important paracrine factors in the pituitary]]
[[Build gene networks related to pituitary disorders]]
[[Scale-free networks with gamma less than 2 do not exist]]
[[Simplified network of pituitary cell type output synchronization]]
[[Pituitary network formation based on network science]]
[[Nodes that appeared early in the history of the network are the most connected ones]]
[[Synchronisation is increased in networks with negative degree correlations]]
[[The absence of effects upon removing most of a pituitary cell type is consistent with properties of scale-free networks]]
