There are 3 different spatial domains in beta cells i.e. the cells exhibit polarity [Gan 2017](https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.185116):
- basal domain (in contact with the vasculature)
- lateral domain
- apical domain (with primary cilia)

### The [[Pancreas vasculature]] is important for formation of proper islet architecture

Expressing a double negative form of VEGF-A in zebrafish beta cells causes a disrupted islet architecture despite normal contacts between beta cells and beta-endothelial cells [Mullapudi 2019](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.173674)
