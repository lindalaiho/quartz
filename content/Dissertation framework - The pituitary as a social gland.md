#### Social pituitary gland framework
- Based on [Picard 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.04.017)
- Theory: humans exist in social networks and exhibit community behaviour and so do cells
- What are the common features of human and cell social networks?

What evidence exists that pituitary cells exhibit these features?

1. Shared environment (duh)
2. Communication (CHAPTER 2)
3. Group formation (CHAPTER 1)
4. Synchronization of behaviour (e.g. lactotroph network paper, important for maximized hormone secretion)
5. Functional interdependence (e.g. KO of corticotrophs alters number of was it gonadotrophs)
6. Specialization and division of labour (subtypes of cells proposed)
	- "gonadotropes are a complex and dynamic population consisting of both regulatory and secretory cells" [Childs 1995](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb24965.x)
	- For evidence of pituitary cell heterogeneity, see early section "Cells are not the same" in [Evans 2002](https://doi.org/10.1076/apab.110.1.3.896)
	- "The concept of functional heterogeneity of endocrine cells was first introduced by Hopkins and Farquhar (1973) in their pioneering studies on dissociated pituitary cells, to explain their finding that individual rat somatotropes displayed a differential ability to incorporate labeled aminoacids, which reflected a different biosynthetic capacity" [Gracia-Navarro 2002](https://doi.org/10.1076/apab.110.1.106.907)

#### Ultimate aim: I am looking at 2 *layers* of social interactions
- On top of *physical networks* of pituitary cells (homotypic/heterotypic)
- There also exists a network of paracrine interactions in the pituitary i.e. *communication network*
- I am trying to detect components/molecular mediators of these networks through bioinformatics. Trying to predict mediators of interaction networks between pituitary cells. Molecules mediating (physical and paracrine) interactions between pituitary cells.
- Use the term cell-cell interactions because it encompasses both physical and communication interactions
