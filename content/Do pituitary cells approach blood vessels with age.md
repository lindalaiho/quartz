Might be interesting to think about what happens to these cells found by [Yoshitomi 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep36019) that are not near blood vessels during aging [[Are there hub cells in the pituitary#^443c05]]. I know we don't have staining evidence for the different endocrine cell types but in general are cells closer to vessels in old pituitaries in the imaging data in [Chen 2021](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105242)?
