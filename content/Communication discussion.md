### The effects of paracrine signalling are highly context-dependent
There is just generally a lot of conflicting data in the pituitary paracrine field. Not just regarding expression (my evidence) but the functional effects have also been found to be very different.

Factors that determine effect
- Age: the effects of paracrine signalling as well as migration differs between adult and infantile pituitary cells. "These researchers observed that the releasing hormone is capable of stimulating prolactin secretion through a paracrine factor releasable from gonadotrope cells in infantile cultures but not in adult ([Denef and Andries, 1983](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736574804000280#BIB9)). Another example is angiotensin II regulation of growth hormone release, where in neonatal and infantile pituitaries, angiotensin II stimulates growth hormone secretion and in juvenile and adult pituitaries acts as inhibitor ([Robberecht and Denef, 1988](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736574804000280#BIB31))." [Mendoza-Garrido 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736574804000280) and this paper also shows migration over BSA and in response to EGF is diff bw adult and infantile cells [Gonzalez 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.02.003). Might paracrine actions in the pituitary be more important early on? E.g. Denef's evidence that gonadotrophs can induce PRL secretion from lactotrophs in response to GnRH but this disappears after 2 weeks of age [Denef 2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1440-1681.2001.03421.x). Also melanocortin paracrine effects found in immature pituitary cells but not in adult [Denef 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841398000206). Many of their aggregates are made from 2-week-old pituitary cells. Denef big review shows that ghrelin local role in the pituitary is most important in early postnatal period. And leptin stimulates GH secretion from the foetal pituitary but not adult.
- Hormonal milieu [Carmeliet 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(89)90088-9) i.e. essentially interaction between paracrine and peripheral endocrine signalling "For example, Pau et al. have found that neuropeptide Y can stimulate LH secretion from the pituitaries of intact but not ovariectomized macaques, and that neuropeptide Y has no effect on the sensitivity of macaque gonadotrophs to GnRH (41). In rat pituitaries BauerDantoin et al. found that neuropeptide Y can enhance gonadotropin responses to GnRH, but only in pituitaries from rats in proestrus (42)." [Schwartz 1994](in papers folder)
- Sex
- Species (galanin: [O'Halloran 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(91)90237-M))
- Dose of factor
- Type of culture system i.e. cell lines [Cronin 1980](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-106-3-718) [Zemkova 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.07.003), aggregates, primary culture (perhaps due to cell-cell contact differences)... [Carmeliet 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(89)90088-9)

### Another example of controversy is the question of the type of junctional structures or presence of gap junctions
"Fletcher et al. (22) described GJ between granulated cells identified as PRL cells on the basis of morphological criteria. By contrast, Soji and Herbert (23) found GJ exclusively between nongranulated cells identified as FS cells using the same morphological criteria." [Morand 1996](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/137/8/3356/3037707?login=true)

### Q: why is there so much controversy regarding local pituitary stuff?
Indication of high plasticity? I.e. things are *very* context-dependent and rapidly changing

How far can paracrine factors diffuse in the pituitary? "we have recently started to define pituitary diffusion parameters (e.g. dextrans with similar sizes to some pituitary peptides travel through the pituitary parenchyma at approximately 11 μm/s to a maximum extent of 82 μm)" (evidence in [Lafont 2010](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0902599107))

[For inspiration](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.01.016)

### Evidence that paracrine signalling might be important
- Cells closest to each other don't always show synchronized responses "However, if the gonadotroph network is wired only by cell-cell contact, one could expect that cells in close proximity to each other, should present a similar pattern of response and form clusters where degrees of synchronization may be highest ([19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/#B19), [47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/#B47)). Interestingly, the analysis of clusters by correlation in the patterns of calcium mobilization shows that distant cells respond to GnRH similarly, but cells in contact or surrounded by capillaries may exhibit different responses, indicating that other mechanisms such as paracrine communication or connectivity with FS cells play an important role in the network function ([64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/#B64), [148](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/#B148), [149](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/#B149))" [Santiago-Andres 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/)
- FS cells inhibit hormone production of other pituitary cells. Here they discuss that FS cells might be physically blocking access of hormonal cells to releasing factors or reduce excitability of the hormonal cells but all their evidence points instead to a paracrine factor as intimate contacts between cells don't appear to be required and some kind of FS cell solution can produce the same effects. [Baes 1987](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-120-2-685)

### Paracrine niches

Perhaps these exist to maintain the [[Regionality in the pituitary]]
