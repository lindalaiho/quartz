"Secretory cells of the anterior pituitary are far more forthcoming in releasing the products by which they are primarily characterized than yielding insights into the mechanisms by which they operate." [Schwartz 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(96)03898-1)

"To date the intercellular milieu of the pituitary gland and its local variations have been widely neglected by physiologists" [Krisch 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00214248) (the situation hasn't improved much...)

"We have learned that cells determine their fate themselves by recruiting resources in the microenvironment rather than by obeying gods acting from remote places" [Denef's website](https://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0009251/) [[Carl Denef]]

"Not only do pituitary cells release hormones to inform distant glands of physiological developments, but they also instruct their hypophyseal colleagues" [McArdle 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1043-2760(01)00520-3)
