The theory would be that the oscillatory outputs of pituitary hormones are synchronised in some way (i.e., they are coupled).

Essentially, we have a network where each node is the oscillatory ultradian output of a pituitary hormone and edges represent the coupling between nodes. Edges have 2 dimensions: (a) weight = coupling strength (degree to which a change in one node will affect change in an adjacent node) and (b) length = phase delay (the time delay of propagation from change in one node to change in the connected node).

Note that the properties of the edges are likely to change over time and in response to a change in conditions.

As depicted in the figure, we might also have a network that includes the hypothalamic and peripheral factors of the axes.
