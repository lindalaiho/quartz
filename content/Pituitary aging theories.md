[[Do pituitary cells approach blood vessels with age]]
[[Decreased stability of gene expression is a feature of pituitary aging]]

FS cell dysfunction is key to aging. Bc with age the endocrine/vascular cells start to secrete "junk" and since FS cells are responsible for disposing of this junk, the fact that the junk accumulates suggests that FS cells are not capable of clearing all of it (evidence that junk is secreted in [Inoue 1999](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.62.205))

The rate of oxygen consumption (per AP weight) in the male rat AP decreased steadily from P16-24 to P150-200 [Levey 1957](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplegacy.1957.189.1.86)
