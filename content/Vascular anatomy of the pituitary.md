"Three to four portal venules connect the dorsal capillary beds of the neural and anterior lobes" [Gross 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323573) i.e. they come from the ME down to the cleft/IL and then go into the AL and PL. They are only located at the base of the infundibulum.

All evidence points to the direction of blood flow being NL -> AL [Gross 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323573) also because the rate of blood flow is much higher in the NL so makes sense blood flows high P -> low P. [Murakami 1993](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.56.243) did not find any evidence based on resin injections that blood goes from the PD to ME, hypothalamus, IL or PN (resin filled PN much earlier than PD). But the fact that MSH has been detected in long portal vessels suggests that blood can flow in the other direction towards the infundibulum/ME as well [Murakami 1987](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.50.133)

"It has been previously estimated that the anterior lobe receives about 30% of its afferent perfusion from the short portal venular system" [Gross 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323573)

"Bergland and Page (1978, 1979) proposed that blood flow within the pituitary gland might be "circular" in that interlobe blood flow may occur in either direction, a condition that seems possible in vessels such as the portal venules, which must have low luminal pressure permitting backflow under some physiological conditions" "Thus, the experimental and physiological conditions at the time of study may dictate the direction of perfusion in the short portal venules of the dorsal pituitary gland" [Gross 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323573)

"Fourteen to twenty-two short (processo-distal) portal vessels connecting the capillary plexus of the posterior lobe with that of the anterior lobe" [Murakami 1993](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.56.243)

"In the hypophyseal and hypothalamic casts prepared here, it is noteworthy that the hypophyseal blood vascular bed is perfused more promptly than those of other tissue elements of the brain. This suggests that the hypophysis, including the median emience, is one of those organs which are most rapidly and richly supplied with blood." [Murakami 1993](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.56.243)

There are basically two routes of blood flow from the PN to PD: short portal vessels directly connecting PN/infundibulum with PD and then "shunts" that go via the IL [Murakami 1993](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.56.243. These develop at different times: the short portal vessels are most conspicuous in young rats whereas the IL route becomes developed during puberty and during mating/pregnancy.

### Evidence that blood passes into the PD from other sites than the ME
- Evidence that the short portal vessels do supply the PD comes from experiments where the stalk was clamped and dye was injected into the aorta. Dye pooled into the infundibulum and to a lesser extent to the PD, showing that the PD does get blood elsewhere than from the ME. [Porter 1973](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-571129-6.50008-7)
- "The passage of dye from the neural lobe to the adjacent adenohypophesis did not occur through Y-shaped pituitary veins, but appeared to occur through capillaries uniting the two regions" [Page 1983](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-112-1-157) (pig)

If the stalk is resected, it appears that the NL compensates and increases blood input to the PD "In two instances, dye passed from the neural lobe to the adjacent adenohypophysis and filled a larger adenohypophyseal territory than before stalk section" [Page 1983](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-112-1-157)

Note that the IL receives blood from the PN but also directly from the arteries going to the PN

#### What's the point of blood flow from the IL to the PD
- Relevance is implied by the perfusion being developed only after puberty -> "This may suggest that the intermediate lobe becomes active or begins to effectively function after puberty" [Murakami 1985](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.48.69)
- "It is also worthy of attention that the superficial capillaries, especially the most ventral ones, probably those facing the hypophyseal cleft of the intermediate lobe, sometimes show marked sinusoidal dilations. These dilated vessels may mediate the absorption of the colloid in the hypophyseal cleft." [Murakami 1985](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.48.69) -> are they taking up stuff from the IL (MSH? stuff released by neurons innervating the IL?)?

### Theories
Since the endothelium is fenestrated in the pituitary, the main barrier to substance entry/clearance is actually the basemement membrane layer [Farquhar 1961](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F000331976101200704. Does this get regulated somehow to regulate hormone secretion/substance entry?

"What are the chemical and physical relationships of the fluid in the intersinusoidal space and the fibrils encountered therein?" [Rinehart 1955](https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.1091210206)

"This mucinous groundsubstance component [stuff in the ECM] is more prominent in sections of the human pituitary than it is in the glands of small animals" [Rinehart 1955](https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.1091210206) -> so is ECM different in human pituitaries and does this have any functional implications?

"The perisinusoidal and intersinusoidal cells and spaces constitute remarkable structural and functional units" [Rinehart 1955](https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.1091210206)

Role of the short portal vessels in pituitary hormone transport/regulation: "The relative importance of long versus short portal transport in a given species depends not only upon the relative representation of these two types of vessels, but also upon sites of termination of the various hypophysiotropic hormone systems." [Anthony 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0742-8413(98)00024-3) This is only relevant if hypothalamic hormones are secreted into other places than the ME "In rhesus monkeys (_Macaca mulatta_), cynomolgous monkeys (_Macaca fascicularis_) and humans, GnRH terminals also appear to be distributed throughout the entire extent of the neurohypophysis, i.e. from the ME to locations deep within the neural lobe"
