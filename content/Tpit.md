Roles
- Controls cell size as KOs have intermediate lobe pituitary cell volumes 7-fold smaller than WTs [Khetchoumian 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11894-3)
- Regulates organelle content in the intermediate lobe (reduced cellular granularity in KOs as determined by FACS) [Khetchoumian 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11894-3)
- These are both not secondary to POMC absence since POMC KOs had normal cell size and organelle content
