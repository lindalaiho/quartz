- [Andries 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0196-9781(94)00217-T) showed that GnRH can induce prolactin and GH release from perifused neonatal rat pituitaries but that the responses are absent before and after this period. This might be supportive of cellular populations that are already reponsive to GnRH rather than forming and disappearing (although they do that with age...)
- [Schwartz 1989](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2826.1989.tb00089.x) treated dissociated rat cells with a cytotoxic conjugate that eliminated CRH-target cells. These cells had a normal ACTH secretory response to AVP but not to CRH. The cells never acquired a normal response to CRH, suggesting that the AVP-target cells can't interconvert into CRH-target cells i.e. subpopulations are permanent.
	- Critisism: (a) bad conditions in vitro might prevent interconversion which happens in vivo, (b) there are too few corticotrophs in culture, (c) stem cells are the source of new CRH-target cells and they are not present in vitro (source: [Schwartz 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(96)03898-1))
- [Felix 1993](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.1993.265.1.E121) found that neonatal pituitaries contain only one type of lactotroph (secretes both GH and prolactin) while adult pituitaries contain this population plus an adult-onset population (secretes prolactin only) so the neonatal population is of a persisting kind
