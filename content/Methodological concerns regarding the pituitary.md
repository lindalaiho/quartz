### Paracrine
FBS interferes with cell-to-cell interactions bc protein synthesis decreases if pituitary cells are placed close to each other but not if the medium contains FBS, you need serum-free medium for the effect to be observed [Perez 1993](Cell-to-cell interactions inhibit protein synthesis, GH, and LH release in male rat adenohypophyseal cells in vitro, local copy)

### scRNA-seq
Based on this [tweet](https://twitter.com/metapredict/status/1511252265037828097?s=20&t=wvYpLMD3pTQ4GJD6iidERA), it seems that the [Mereu 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0469-4) paper shows that the genes detected by scRNA-seq (as compared to snRNA-seq) are enriched with mitochondrial genes, suggesting that we are more likely to find "interesting mitochondrial narratives". Alternatively, the paper referred to might be [Ding 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0465-8) where they show that 10X genomics chromium v3 detects a higher proportion of mitochondrial genes than some other scRNA-seq technologies

[[The pituitary in vitro is not the pituitary in vivo]]
[[Pituitary cell lines are different from the cell types they were derived from]]

Evidence that cell sorting does **NOT** alter the proportion of pituitary cell types (but they also found no thyrotrophs.......) [Christian 2001](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2826.1999.00389.x)
