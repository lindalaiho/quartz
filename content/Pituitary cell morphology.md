### Ligands regulate microvilli growth in pituitary cells
"TRH induced a 2-fold increase in the number of cells covered with microvilli and a corresponding decrease in the number of smooth surfaced cells. This suggests that hormone secretion is associated with the formation of microvilli." [Spira 1983](https://doi.org/10.1530/acta.0.1040279) also evidence that microvilli form dependent on hormone secretion in lactotrophs "In most cells, estradiol and TRH led to an increase in the number and prominence of microvilli and blebs, whereas CB-154 treatment resulted in a slightly decreased number of microvilli and an increased occurrence of membrane foldings."

### Ligands regulate cell shape
cell shape is changed by dopamine [here](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/54362)

### Cell proliferation
- Proliferation rate goes down with age [Toni 2000](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12116221_The_role_of_flow_cytometry_in_the_study_of_cell_growth_in_the_rat_anterior_pituitary_gland)
- Mitosis rate peaks around noon and and reaches a minimum around midnight but other studies found the opposite [Toni 2000](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12116221_The_role_of_flow_cytometry_in_the_study_of_cell_growth_in_the_rat_anterior_pituitary_gland) 

### Cell size
- Cell size may increase by 30% from day to to day 30 in rats [evidence](https:///doi.org/10.1007/BF00318674)
- Fsh+ve and Lh+ve medaka gonadotrophs increase in size from juvenile to adults [Fontaine 2020](https://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-19-0405)
