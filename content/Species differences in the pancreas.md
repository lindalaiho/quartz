Human islets have a double basement membrane whereas mouse islets only have a single membrane [Virtanen 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-008-0997-9)

[[Pancreatic pericytes]] in human islets have more heterogeneity in terms of morphology and contractile protein expression compared to in the mouse [Goncalves 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.602519) 

Humans have less [[Pancreas vasculature]] than the mouse [Cohrs 2017](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2016-1184):
- Fewer branching points (so less complex)
- Lower total vessel network length
- Reduced vessel diameter

In human islets, ~61% of beta cells and ~75% of alpha cells were located directly next to a blood vessel, whereas in mice >90% of both cell types were apposed to the [[Pancreas vasculature]] [Cohrs 2017](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2016-1184)
