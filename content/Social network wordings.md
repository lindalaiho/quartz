"Together these analyses reveal a highly complex *social structure* among the immune-cell types in which both shared execution of tasks and specialized execution of tasks are pervasive" [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3727)

"Given the *complex communication architecture* of signal transduction in the immune system, it is apparent that multiple parallel pathways' influencing and regulating each other is not the exception but is instead the norm" (same as above)

"Just as social networks are embedded into cities with distinct neighborhoods that may serve different purposes, it has been observed that the different tasks of hepatocytes are divided spatially within the liver. Remaining with this analogy, cities rely on critical infrastructure, such as power and water supply or waste disposal. In the context of the immune system, the transport of nutrients and other molecules in and out of the cell could be monitored by metabolomics linked with proteomics expression analysis to establish metabolite–receptor–transporter networks" (same) -> do pituitary cells in different regions of the pituitary play distinct roles? And blood vessels are quite nice analogied to pipes and infrastructure needed to support cell function

"a system-wide view of how cells exchange information had not been established because of technological limitations" [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3693)

"Our study should be considered a starting point for the investigation of *intercellular information exchange* at higher cellular and contextual resolution." (same as above)

"A *high density of internal networking* is characteristic of cognitive systems such as the brain – neurons spend much time communicating among themselves while they interact with their environment." [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1745-6150-1-32)

Trying to figure out the "syntax" or "logic" of how cells encode their unique surface identities in terms of CAMs or how they communicate paracrinically

"*Cellular sociology* regulates the hierarchical spatial patterning and organization of cells in organisms" [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsob.200300)

"Advances in single-cell biotechnology have increasingly revealed interactions of cells with their surroundings, suggesting *a cellular society at the microscale*." (same)

Working principles could be the same in human and cell networks

"individualistic" vs "collectivist" perspectives of cellular function

"To provide a framework emphasizing the interactions between cells" [still here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsob.200300)

Do corticotrophs begin to exhibit antisocial behaviour in stress?

"communication which occurs within and between groups of cells" (Reynolds 2011)

What might the cells be trying to say when they send these signals to each other?

I am applying a "cell sociology" approach/perspective to the pituitary

"A cell's features therefore (it's individuality in her words) are neither determined from above ["obeying gods from above" (Denef)] by some supracellular field nor are they entirely pre-formed ["self-determination] within the cell itself. Its individuality (just like a person's personality) is an epigenetic result of the social interactions it has with those other cells with which it has the most contact" i.e. not , they arise from the context of a gland i.e. via interactions (Reynolds 2011)

"It is well-known today that cells reciprocally exchange information at every moment; in other words, they reciprocally impose on each other traits of their own individuality" (Reynolds 2011)

"Exchange of information occurs by cell contact" and through diffusible factors

I am a pituitary cell sociologist :)

"It is to recognize that in order to understand fully how living (multicellular) organisms are created and are able to maintain function one must see them, not just as groups of cells or genes or molecules, but as social phenomena with emergent properties made possible by the interaction between units of different levels of organization (molecules, cells, condensations, tissues, organs, organs systems, organisms, environment)." (Reynolds 2011)

"Comparatively little is known, however, about how these proteins interact and are spatially arranged within the 'functional modules' of the cell: that is, the 'molecular sociology' of the cell"" (in Reynolds 2011) -> we have lists of pituitary paracrine interactions but no understanding of how they work

"Cell sociology highlights the importance of what are known as ‘group’ or ‘community effects,’ which are instances of emergent properties dependent upon the interaction of multiple cells. The lesson to be drawn from this is that cells are very much social beings, not just in the sense that they tend to engage in a lot of interaction with one another, but that they are _transformed_ by these social interactions, so that a proper understanding of cells and the organisms they comprise requires thinking about cells as more than just inert ‘building blocks’ or complicated machines." (Discovering the Ties that Bind: Cell-Cell Communication and the Development of Cell Sociology)

"the cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules that literally ties cells together as colonies and bodies" (same as above)

"cells are not only morphological and physiological units but social units too" (Reynolds 2018)

"cytoplasmic bridges from cell to cell may be a physiological system … which provide for the maintenance of a strong *social system* among the cell elements" in (Reynolds 2018)

It's all really a balance of social interactions within a group (cell type) and between groups (cell types)

"A key question in this context is how, in large clusters of cells (e.g., tissues or organs), cluster-wide functionalities emerge as collective phenomena from local cellular interactions (e.g., communication and cooperation) encoded into individual cells."
