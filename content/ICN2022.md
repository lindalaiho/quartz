# Presentation notes

### What do the established corticotroph paracrine ligands do?

Note: many of these ligands are expressed in non-corticotroph pituitary cell types as well so it's difficult to distinguish whether a functional effect of a ligand is due to secretion from that specific cell type (although presumably the effects should be the same independent of the source?? but there was that one paper I found during my reading for corticotroph paracrine stuff for diss chapter 3, maybe foreign authors, it was obscure, not many citations...they suggested the source is relevant for one of the pituitary paracrine ligands)

Apelin
- Expression (male rats)
	- Immunofluorescence to apelin is 96.5% in cells co-staining for ACTH (rest somatotrophs) [Reaux-Le Goazigo](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00521.2005)
	- In situ hybridisation for apelin receptor mRNA is high in cells staining for ACTH [Reaux-Le Goazigo](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00521.2005)
- Function (male rats)
	- In an ex vivo perifusion system, apelin increased basal ACTH release by 41% and increased K+ stimulated ACTH release in a dose-dependent manner [Reaux-Le Goazigo](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00521.2005)

CART
- Expression
	- Double-label IHC with antisera against pituitary hormones in male rat pituitaries found 5% of CART+ve cells were ACTH cells [Smith 2006](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2005-1392)
	- ICC for ACTH and in situ hybridisation for prepro-CART showed that 28% of ppCART+ve cells were ACTH cells in male rat pituitaries [Stanley 2004](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00576.2003)
	- CART expression in the pituitary is regulated by CRH and glucocorticoids [Stanley 2004](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00576.2003)
- Function
	- Incubation of CART with dispersed male rat pituitary cells reduced basal secretion of all pituitary hormones (but the effect depended on dose) [Chmielowska](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2017.03.003)

Galanin
- Expression
	- Immunostaining for galanin and ACTH in dispersed female rat pituitary cells showed double labelling, subcellularly some of the 2 peptides also colocalised [Cimini 1996](https://doi.org/10.1006/excr.1996.0319)
	- Expression of galanin is developmentally regulated [Cimini]
- Function
	- Galanin inhibited basal ACTH release from dispersed female rat pituitary cells and galanin antiserum abolished the effect [Cimini 1996](https://doi.org/10.1006/excr.1996.0319)

GRP
- Expression
	- GRP IR is in a proportion of corticotrophs and lactototrophs in pituitary reaggregates of male rats [Houben 1991](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-128-6-3208)
- Function
	- Absence of effects on hormone release in [Houben 1991](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-128-6-3208)
	- GRP increased GH release in perifused cultures of female rat pituitary cells [Kentroti 1985](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-117-4-1363)

NMU
- Expression
	- NMU immunostaining is present in corticotrophs in female mouse and rat pituitaries
	- NMU was also co-localised with galanin and ACTH in the same secretory granules [Cimini 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323579)
	- ADX increases NMU expression in the pituitary [Cimini 1993](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00323579)
	- Expression of NMU is developmentally regulated in corticotrophs [Cimini]
- Function
	- ???

ANP
- Expression
	- ANP IR is present in male rat corticotrophs and gonadotrophs (but ID based on morphologica criteria?) [Morel 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(88)90137-2)
- Function
	- ANP inhibits basal and GHRH-stimulated GH release from cultured male rat pituitaries [Shibasaki 1986](https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-291X(86)91032-6)
	- ANP inhibits basal and CRH-stimulated ACTH release from cultured male rat pituitaries [Shibasaki 1986](https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-291X(86)91032-6)
	- ANP inhibits plasma ACTH levels in sheep (no effect of ICV administration but i.v. produced the effect) [Fink 1991](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.131R009)

NPY
- Expression
	- NPY IR in female rat gonadotrophs, somatotrophs and corticotrophs, some lactotrophs [Chabot 1988](https://doi.org/10.1159/000124963)
- Function
	- NPY stimulates basal PRL, GH and LH release from cultured female rat pituitary cells [Chabot 1988](https://doi.org/10.1159/000124963)

Urocortin 2
- Expression
	- UCN2 is expressed in POMC cells in rats (supposedly) [Nemoto](https://joe.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/joe/192/2/1920443.xml)
	- CRH increased UCN2 expression and secretion in cultured male rat pituitary cells, DEX inhibited UCN2 expression and secretion [Nemoto](https://joe.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/joe/192/2/1920443.xml)
- Function
	- In pituitary monolayer culture, UCN2 inhibits basal FSH and LH secretion and the effect is the reverse with UCN2 inhibition [Nemoto 2009](https://doi.org/10.1677/JOE-08-0467)
	- An anti-UCN2 antibody blocks stress-induced suppression of plasma LH [Nemoto 2010](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00163.2010)

### What is the evidence that HSPs are actually targeted by Wnt4 signalling? I.e. what did NicheNet use as their source?
Integrated various signalling databases and knowledge from the literature, e.g. pathway commons, knockout experiments, ChIP-seq

### What's the differential expression situation for the 2 HSPs? Are they actually DE in all cell types, if not, in which?
Well that's tricky...... TBC

### What's the role of WNTs during pituitary development?
- WNTs regulate expression of key TFs that are needed for pituitary cell specification

### What to say if someone asks about the other identified interactions?

### In what pituitary cell types is beta-catenin expressed?
It's expressed uniformly throughout the pituitary
