### Experimental clues
[Iturriza 1991](https://doi.org/10.1159/000125700) grafted anterior lobes under the renal capsule which caused MSH to appear in corticotrophs in addition to ACTH. Upon CRH infusion the MSH disappeared from the corticotrophs. Why were these corticotroph now able to express MSH? The authors gave 2 hypotheses:
	(a) There was reduced ACTH secretion due to hypothalamic CRH not reaching the grafts which allowed time for processing into MSH and when loads of CRH was injected the ACTH was secreted which abolished the time needed for processing 
	(b) Some hypothalamic factor inhibits the cleavage into MSH (so inhibit PC1) and since this inhibitory factor did not reach the grafts MSH was able to be expressed

### Embryonic and neonatal (up to P14) corticotrophs exhibit different POMC processing from adult corticotrophs
What is different? [Sato 1985](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-117-2-773)
	1. They accumulate lots of unprocessed POMC (almost half of all POMC is not processed further)
	2. They produce MSH (but note that it is not N-acetylated)

Why is it different?
- Glucocorticoids appear to inhibit cleavage into MSH
	- If you place corticotrophs from newborn rats into culture without glucocorticoids there is lots of cleavage into MSH and this cleavage is suppressed when you add glucocorticoids [Noel 1991](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-129-3-1317)
	- AHA this makes sense bc melanotrophs don't express GR while corticotrophs do AND there is that stress hyporesponsive period (low glucocorticoids) in neonates that would allow MSH production

### However, there is evidence of MSH production in postnatal corticotrophs
