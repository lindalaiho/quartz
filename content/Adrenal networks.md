[Desarmenien 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3938) showed that chromaffin cells secreting catecholamines in the adrenal medulla are coupled by gap junctions. The gap junctions in the medulla seemed to mostly be composed of Cx36 whereas Cx43 was dominant in the cortex. Blocking gap junctions reduced catecholamine release in response to nerve stimulation. The coupling was increased in [[chronic stress]].
