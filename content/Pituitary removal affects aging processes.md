Hypophysectomy at 70 days of age in male rats significantly increases lifespan but hypophysectomy at 400 days decreases lifespan BUT food restriction has the same effects as hypothysectomy at 70 days [Everitt 1980](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-6374(80)90092-5)
- Note: all rats were on cortisone replacement therapy
- Outcomes measured:
	- Collagen fibre aging
	- Protein excretion
	- Tumour incidence
	- Lung disease
	- Cardiac and renal function
