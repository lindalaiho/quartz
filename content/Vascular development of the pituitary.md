### Rat

Immature blood vessels surround Rathke's pouch at E14, they begin to invade on E15 and then on E16 the anterior lobe is clearly vascularised [Schechter 1993](https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1001970202)

Pituitary vasculogenesis starts with invasion of extra-pituitary cells. [Higuchi 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-015-2128-5) find that some of these cells are PRRX1 and PRRX2 +ve and they may give rise to endothelial cells and pericytes in the pituitary.
