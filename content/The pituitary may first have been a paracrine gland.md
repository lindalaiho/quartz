Theory proposed in [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475): "However, although a diffusional hypothalamic control of the pituitary is an established concept for these groups, we could hypothesize that diffusional paracrine control preceded it in evolutionary time. In the simplest form in a hypothetical common ancestor to lamprey and hagfish, adenohyophysial-like cells would communicate through paracrine, juxtacrine and autocrine mechanisms. [...] "Hypothalamic control must have appeared soon after or perhaps simultaneously with paracrine control, since inappropriate pituitary hormone secretion due to asynchrony with the brain (and the environmental cues it mediates) would reduce organismal fitness and survival."

It is perhaps also pertinent to note the evolutionary history of the pituitary gland. 

If the pituitary is only responsive to hypothalamic hormones then why does it receive inputs from so many places? re [[Evidence for multimodal communication in the pituitary]]

Note that the shift to hemal regulation of the pituitary from regulation through innervation happened during the water-to-land transition (end of section 7.1.1. in [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475))

In early species pituitary hormones such as GH and LH acted as paracrine factors [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475) section 8
