### Confusion regarding the identity of pericytes
- Pericytes may possess mesenchymal stem cell properties (although this has not been specifically shown in the pituitary) [Diaz-Flores 2006](https://www.hh.um.es/pdf/Vol_21/21_9/Diaz-Flores-21-995-1027-2006.pdf)
- The TtT/GF FS cell line actually has many properties of pericytes/vascular cells, e.g. expression of PDGFRb and NG2 [Yoshida 2014](https://doi.org/10.1262/jrd.2014-031)
- In the mouse pituitary, 20% of PDGFRb +ve cells were in contact with blood vessels (vessels marked by intravascular perfusion with opaque resin) but 80% were not and they were distributed in a pattern that resembles the location of FS cells [O'Hara 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/jne.12903) ^598c65
- According to [Tateno 2016](https://doi.org/10.1530/ERC-16-0013), in mouse pituitaries NG2 is expressed (IHC) in FS cells and weakly in some AP cells including somatotrophs, lactotrophs and thyrotrophs (but not in gonadotrophs or corticotrophs)

Evidence that pericytes are present in the pituitary
- In rabbits [Popoff 1943](https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.1090870102)
- In rats [Jindatip 2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-012-0144-z)

Description of pituitary pericytes in the rat [Jindatip 2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-012-0144-z)
- They report desmin as a marker for pericytes
- "In normal rats, pericytes had limited cytoplasm, high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and poorly developed cell organelles."
- Pericyte characteristics are altered by castration [[Evidence that pituitary vasculature is targeted by challenge#Castration]]
- They identified 4 types of pericytes based on morphology  ^a74a85
	- Oval-to-round pericytes: primary projections with 2-3 "side-projections", most frequent type (50% of pericytes)
	- Elongate pericytes: long cell bodies, 28% of pericytes
	- Triangular pericytes: usually present at bifurcations/branches of capillaries, 17% of pericytes
	- Multiangular pericytes: flat cell body, often on large capillaries, 5% of pericytes
- Also reported a non-pericyte desmin +ve cell type that was detched from the capillary wall. In contrast to typical pericytes, they had more cytoplasm and had no basement membrane

### Changes to pericytes in response to challenge
- Development (P5 to P30) in the rat [Jindatip 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-013-0180-3)
	- Change from a more active to less active phenotype and decrease collagen (col1a1 and col3a1) synthesis
- Cancer (prolactinoma) in the rat [[Evidence that pituitary vasculature is targeted by challenge#^52e04b]]
- Endocrine disruption (BPA administration during pregnancy) [[Evidence that pituitary vasculature is targeted by challenge#^16b992]]
- Removal of FS cells [Tsukada 2016](https://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-16-0033) ^6a3931
	- In reaggregates of rat pituitary cells from S100b-GFP animals with the GFP +ve cells sorted out, the number of pericytes (ID'd as desmin +ve cells) is significantly reduced
	- Does this mean that FS cells are required to maintain the pericyte population?

### What is the function of pituitary pericytes?
- Regulate cell proliferation? [Tateno 2016](https://doi.org/10.1530/ERC-16-0013)
	- Knocking out pRb (tumour suppressor) in NG2-expressing cells leads to major development of Pit1 +ve tumours in the pituitary, many of which were plurihormonal (GH, PRL, aGSU, TSH)
	- GH4 cells (GH/PRL cell line) transfected with NG2 showed increased PRL and reduced GH expression and transfection also increased GH4 cell adhesion (but not proliferation...)
