[[How corticotrophs are in contact with each other]]
[[FS cell junctions]]

In rhesus monkeys, desmosomes, hemidesmosomes and adherens junctions were observed between endocrine cells, between FS cells and between endocrine and FS cells. None of the endocrine cells seemed to be enriched with a certain type of junctional structure. Mostly the junctions were located away from the vasculature - so might endocrine cell-vascular connections involve other adhesion than these structures? [Herbert 1979](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ar.1091950101)

When looking at pituitary reaggregates, any junctional complexes between endocrine cells were very rare [here](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.a.10065)

N-cadherin mostly found between endocrine cells, some E-cadherin in scattered clusters. N-cadherin staining strongest in somatotrophs, especially som-som connections. [here](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.a.20384)

Tight junctions between HPCs and desmosomes bw FS cells [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00214248)

No obvious junctional complexes between HPCs but FS cells have desmosomes [Kagayama 1965](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/77/6/1053/2696284?redirectedFrom=fulltext) - would this suggest the junctional structures might be of an atypical sort? Might there also be species differences (would explain my diff results in humans vs mouse for ex) bc this was dog pituitary where they didn't see clear junctions. The other studies that saw no junctional structures, did they use the same technology i.e. should they have seen the structures?

Tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes all identified between FS cells in the human [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2013622/pdf/amjpathol00420-0098.pdf)

Tight junctions, desmosomes form between FS cells even in monolayer culture [Ferrara 1987](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpendo.1987.252.3.e304?journalCode=ajpendo)

HPCs form junctional complexes in vitro: desmosomes, gap junctions, tight junctions [Wilfinger 1984](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040816684900260). Desmosomes and gap junctions were more difficult to identify. Also desmosomes and adherens junctions in vitro [here](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/67/2/469/77436/Intercellular-communication-in-the-rat-anterior)

"During our studies. we have observed considerable variation in length and breadth of the tight junction network between adjacent cells. In some cases we have observed junctional strands which traverse less than 0.05 Âµm of membrane surface and contain only one or two parallel strands of intramembrane particles (Fig. 7). while other cells contain junctions which appear to circumscribe the cell and contain 6-12 parallel strands of intramembrane particles (Figs. 4. 6, 8). The intramembrane particles in the large junctions form continuous ridges on the P-face of the replica (Figs. 4. 6) while the small junctions often contain discontinuous rows of particles (Fig. 7). The complementary grooves which are observed on the E-face of the fracture plane are usually well defined and contain relatively few intramembrane particles. Since relatively little is known about the biochemical structure and regulation of these membrane structures, it is difficult to determine whether these changes represent various stages of junctional turnover (Suzuki and Nagano, 1979; Risinger and Larsen. 19X1, 1983) or fixation and glycerol-induced membrane changes (Pinto da Silva and Kachar, 1982)." and "The distribution of the intramembranous particles within the plasma membrane also appeared to fluctuate significantly. The lateral membrane of some cells contain relatively few membrane particles (Fig. 9) while other cells were characterized by a higher density of particles (Figs. 4, 6, 7)" - *so could this explain why my scRNA-seq data could show variation in terms of expression, perhaps we would not expect the CAM in every cell or at high expression level?* "Intramembrane particle density on the apical and lateral membrane surface also displayed regional variability (Figs. 4, 8). Since it is not always possible to identify specific cell types after freeze-fracture analysis, we have not been able to determine whether these variations can be attributable to different types of anterior pituitary cells (i.e. mammotroph vs. gonadotroph) or simply reflect differing degrees of heterogeneity within the same population of cells." [Wilfinger 1984](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040816684900260)

Desmosomes and adherens junctions between HPCs [Fletcher 1975](https://rupress.org/jcb/article/67/2/469/77436/Intercellular-communication-in-the-rat-anterior)

Desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, adherens junctions between pituitary cells in the rhesus monkey [Herbert 1979](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ar.1091950101)

Desmosomes exist between lactotrophs [Saunders 1982](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/145580)

The absence of tight junctions in rat, mouse, rabbit in previous studies might be explained by physiological state say [Wilfinger 1984](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040816684900260): "In adrenal, ovarian and pancreatic tissue, physiologic stimuli which enhance hormone secretion have been shown to significantly increase the proliferation of tight junctional elements (Orci, 1976) as well as gap junction number and size (Meda et al., 1979; Decker et al., 1978; Larsen et al., 1981). If intercellular contacts within the anterior pituitary gland are regulated by similar mechanisms, the physiologic state of the animal at the time of sacrifice could have a major effect on the number, size and type of junctional complexes that are expressed within this tissue. Since previous investigators have not reported the sex, age or physiological status of the donor animals, it is difficult to determine how these variables have affected the data which have been presented in previous reports."

Tight junctions in folliculostellate cells [2014 paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00441-014-1827-7)

"The main junctions characterized in pituitary cell aggregates are desmosomes and septa containing junctions" [Allaerts 1990](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/127/3/1517/2534079)

Denef's pituitary aggregates have probably tight junctions but at least adherens junctions and "Other cellular junctions, consisting of an approximation of the plasma membranes with small, regularly spaced bridges in the intercellular spaces (Fig. 3C), were similar to the septa-containing junctions described by Staehelin (22)." [Van Der Schueren 1982](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/110/2/513/2590926)

In the rat pituitary, intercellular contacts resembling focal tight junctions have been observed [Krisch 1984](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00214248)

It is also possible that contacts between cells induce changes in cell morphology. [Allaerts 1991](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00318763) suggest that lactotrophs might become cup-shaped when associated with gonadotrophs.

beta 1 integrins are expressed in the pituitary [Horacek 1994](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02631416) and also alpha integrins [Kikuchi 2005](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ahc/38/6/38_6_381/_article/-char/ja/) and laminins [Ramadhani 2012](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ahc/45/5/45_12028/_article/-char/ja/) which show changes during development [Ramadhani 2014](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ahc/47/5/47_14031/_article/-char/ja/)
