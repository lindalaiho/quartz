Delta cells have protrusions that connect to other cell types in the pancreas. In response to systemic/paracrine factors, these protrusions change length, allowing more contact with other cell types. The protrusions also have Ca spikes that are not always synchronised with cytoplasmic Ca spikes. When you chemogenetically activate delta cells, you get inhibition of beta cell Ca oscillations, consistent with inhibitory effect of SST from delta cells on beta cell activity. In prediabetic animals, delta cell Ca activity is impaired and the delta cell protrusions were longer. Since the delta cells are rare in the islet, the authors suggest that the protrusions are responsible for increasing contact with the other cell types.

Deleting delta cells (SST-Cre) in the pancreas and using DREADDs to inhibit SST secretion  both showed that delta cells via paracrine SST determine the glycemic set point in the pancreas by dampening insulin secretion. Note that ablating alpha cells had no effect! [Huang 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.29.496132)
