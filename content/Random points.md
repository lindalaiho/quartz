"Based on the work of Yamaki and collaborators, it has been demonstrated that the sequential development of endocrine cells in theÂ mammalian pituitary varies largely in other vertebrates without a clear pattern, even close species show diversity in pituitary developmental programming" [vertebrate review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873642/) - would this support that humans and e.g. mice show differences in the networks at least in terms of during development?
