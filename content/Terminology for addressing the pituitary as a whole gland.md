How do we *coordinate* the function of the pituitary gland?

There is an "intrapituitary regulatory system" [Devnath 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01716.x)

Project summary: intrapituitary interactions or cell-cell interactions in the pituitary
The findings in my dissertation are "foundations for testable hypotheses" [Trudeau 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113475)

*Crosstalk* between cell types

cells have unique *surface identities* both in terms of CAMs and ligands/receptors - that determine how they interact with other cells

"A complex cell-to-cell communication network coordinates..."

Cells are "interwoven" i.e. in networks. "The tissues of the adrenal medulla and cortex are signiﬁcantly more interwoven in many mammals, including humans, than was previously thought". not just networks but also interwoven in terms of function, as discussed [here](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19970315)36:6%3C520::AID-JEMT9%3E3.0.CO;2-L)

The social (nature of) corticotrophs/pituitary cells [Picard 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.04.017)

"cells live in communities" i.e. the pituitary is also a community

Network/contact/proximity-dependent paracrine communication (for evidence see those papers that show disruption of cells into single cells leads to altered communication)

### Adhesion
junctional complexes: more than glue sticking cells together

cell adhesion molecules - more than intercellular glue

### Communication
"neighbourhood watch"

Pituitary cells form collectives ([[Regionality in the pituitary|perhaps in different regions]])

### Potential quotes to use

"The pituitary conceals a trove of tempting questions. Some of these are being exposed, some are being answered." [Evans 2002](https://doi.org/10.1076/apab.110.1.3.896) -> my dissertation has mainly done the former

"if the language of words is not sufficient then perhaps it is time to ask mathematicians again what they make of it. Ask them to discuss the multidimensionality of pituitary function: the topography relative to sources of paracrine factors, the accessibility of hypothalamic regulating factors, the concentrations of target organ feedback messengers, the intracellular chemistry (enzymes, trafficking instruments, ions, and others), components of classical phenotypes, the cell’s state relative to developmental maturation, the state relative to future physiological need..." [Evans 2002](https://doi.org/10.1076/apab.110.1.3.896)

"It is part of the curious attraction of the physiology and biochemistry of the pituitary that we can neither study everything together nor understand anything in isolation." [Evans 2002](https://doi.org/10.1076/apab.110.1.3.896)
