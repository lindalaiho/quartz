- Pituitary cells should logically have both *non-specific CAMs* that allow them to adhere non-specifically to any pituitary cell since the cells do form aggregates and *specific CAMs* that allow them to adhere to cells of the right type: "the factors responsible for both kinds of adhesion [specific and non-specific] are present simultaneously, but that the emergence of the selective adhesion is elicited through prolonged contact between the differing tissues" -> the authors suggest that homotypic CAMs only get upregulated when cells of the same type are in contact? But how would they recognise that the other cell is the right type without the homotypic CAMs? (this is in a way similar to Paul's suggested "happy molecules" that the cells make when they are happy i.e. when they are together with a cell of the same type) This could also be consistent with the time taken for cells to sort themselves into the correct arrangement in reaggregates
- Is there a role for cell polarity in forming the pituitary architecture? Could homotypic CAMs be clustered together on one side of the cell membrane, allowing homotypic cells to form clusters, and heterotypic cells on another side? But this isn't really consistent with the strings of homotypic cells that have been observed...
- Could there be contact inhibition? This would be similar to having "repulsion molecules" that prevent certain cells from adhering together, could this help promote homotypic adhesion?
- Is the analogy of self vs non-self recognition like in MHC complexes relevant? As in pituitary cell types present some kind of antigen so that other cells know self from non-self?
