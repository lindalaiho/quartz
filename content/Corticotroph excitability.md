### Basal conditions
During basal conditions, corticotrophs exhibit single-spike action potentials and in response to CRH, almost all cells transition to bursting
- This bursting behaviour is dependent on BK channels which in turn are activated by L-type Ca channels since blocking BK channels with paxilline prevents transition to bursting

Glucocorticoids prevent corticotroph bursting by blocking BK channels

### Effects of chronic stress [Duncan 2021](https://doi.org/10.1113/JP282367)
In contrast to basal, corticotrophs after 14 days of restraint stress can be separated into 2 subpopulations:
- (a) *stressed bursters*: some spontaneous bursts in absence of CRH and more bursting in response to CRH
- (b) *stressed spikers*: no bursting in the absence of CRH and no bursting, only more spikes in response to CRH

What is behind this increased basal bursting in chronic stress?
- Not increased Ca as increasing iCa could not induce bursting
- Model indicated that increased colocalisation of BK channels with Ca channels and decreased BK channel activation time constant allow the increased basal bursting
	- BUT applying BK channel blocker paxilline did not fully prevent bursting in response to CRH in stressed corticotrophs (but did prevent basal bursting)
	- This difference in stressed and unstressed cells was bc in the stressed cells the total BK current near the peak of an action potential was greater than in control cells

There are 2 splice variants of BK channels that have different properties:
- (a) ZERO (is sufficient to produce bursting behaviour)
- (b) STREX (enhances duration of burst)

Stressed corticotrophs showed much greater heterogeneity in terms of burst factor (how much bursting behaviour they show)
- According to modelling, this can be explained by variable BK channel activation time constant and BK channel location (with respect to L-type Ca channels)
