Paracrine factors secreted from alpha cells can determine the Ca oscillation frequency in beta cells and the number of alpha cells in the islet was highly correlated with the Ca oscillation frequency [Ren 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31373-6)

Pancreatic cells show even higher correlation when 'deactivating' in response to glucose compared to activating in response to glucose - authors speculate that it might help prevent hypoglycemic episodes [Stozer 2013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002923)
