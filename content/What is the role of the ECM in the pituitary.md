How elastic is the ECM in the pituitary i.e. how high is the collagen vs elastin concentration relative to other organs?

Does it regulate intercellular communication? If so, how?
- By providing diffusion barriers? [[Regionality in the pituitary]] or otherwise regulating access of molecules to cells
- By deciding which cells have access to each other or regulating cellular proximity?
- By activating CCC receptors? Collagen/laminin/fibronectin can also activate cellular signalling


Based on unpublished (?) results from [[Patrice Mollard]] it may "store" hormone before it is released into the blood

Determining which cells adhere to each other
