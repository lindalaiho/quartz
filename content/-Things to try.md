Is there a division of labour among the e.g. corticotrophs where some of the cells are specialised in hormone secretion and another set in regulatory behaviour? Could check whether ACTH distribution is higher among some cells and if those cells express more paracrine peptides. In general, are all the paracrine peptides in corticotrophs expressed by the same cells? Could be good to look at the autocrine peptides to see if same cells secrete all of them? [[Are there hub cells in the pituitary]]

Could we use melanotrophs as negative control? Intermediate lobe isn't supposed to contain blood vessels so we should expect low communication potential between melanotrophs and endothelial cells (unless signals can travel far). Compare to other cell types where potential should be much higher. Especially in terms of adhesion molecules.

Look at cell-cell communication between PT and lactotrophs? So try to identify the elusive "tuberalins" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648017302320
