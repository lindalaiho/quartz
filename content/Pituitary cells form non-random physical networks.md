There was a shift from the pituitary being seen as a gland of scattered cells to an organised network of cells - **a network view of the pituitary**

This was an important clue since structure suggests function. Indeed, the earliest reports thinking about internal regulation of the pituitary mentions the fact that pituitary cells have [[Topographical affinities]] towards each other

Scattered -> organised
Random -> ordered
Isolated -> connected

Evidence that monolayer culture does not represent true pituitary structure: "Indeed, GH cells, LH cells, TSH cells, and ACTH cells were not often found in contact with other cells of the same type" [Morand 1996](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/137/8/3356/3037707?login=true)

"These anatomical arrangements likely have consequences for cell-to-cell communication within the islet to the point where paracrine interactions may play a dominating role in orchestrating hormone secretion in the human islet" [Caicedo 2013](https:///doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2012.09.007) -> if the textbook view of the pituitary was accurate, why don't we have just separate regions of cells like in the was it zebrafish? In rodents (and humans?) the cells are intermixed which is likely not a concidence but may imply that the connections between the different cell types in networks have functional relevance.
