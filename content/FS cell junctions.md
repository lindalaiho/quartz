### Evidence for the conflicting existence of junctions bw FS cells
- Dogs: desmosomes [Kagayama 1965](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-77-6-1053)
- Humans: all of tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes [Bergland 1969](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2013622/)
- Bovine: tight junctions and desmosomes in monolayer culture [Ferrara 1987](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.1987.252.3.E304)
- Rhesus monkey: adherens junctions [Herbert 1979](https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.1091950101)
- Rats: tight junctions [Garcia-Godinez 2014](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1827-7)
- Mouse, rat and human: tight junctions (exclusively bw FS cells) [Higashi 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-01004-z)

### Conflicting evidence for the composition of TJs bw FS cells
- Composed of claudin 4 in the rat [Garcia-Godinez 2014](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1827-7)
- Composed of claudin 9 in mice, rats and humans with no evidence of claudin 4 [Higashi 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-01004-z)
- [Higashi 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-01004-z) suggest that claudin 9 could be used as a specific marker for FS cells but looking at the integrated mouse pituitary scRNA-seq data claudin 9 is expressed in almost all pituitary cell types... 

### What is the function of the junctions?
- Has been suggested that they act as some kind of barrier [Krisch 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00214248)
- But there is also evidence that TJs do not fully seal the follicular lumina created by the FS cells [Mabuchi 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-8166(96)80066-8)
