Conceptual ways of how the 2 might interlink:
- Pituitary cells are "arranged to enable intercellular interactions within and between cell types" [Schwartz 1992](https://doi.org/10.1210/edrv-13-3-453)
- Perhaps the importance of interaxis cell-cell interactions may be inferred from the fact that mammalian pituitaries show much more interlinked cellular relationships compared to e.g. fish which have cells of the cell type form more regionalized clusters

Purpose of the 2 working together could be to achieve specificity
- "The most critical aspect of cellular communication is specificity: Who receives what kind of message from whom, and when?" [here](https://www-annualreviews-org.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/doi/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100617-062932) and this could be achieved not only by receptor/ligand expression but also by structual constraints by cytonemes and pituitary structural organisation

Theory: blurred lines between adhesion molecules and paracrine factors/receptors would make it possible that physical networks and paracrine networks may be interlinked i.e. the same factors may regulate pituitary cells by contributing to network adhesion but could also be cleaved off to act as paracrine factors. Seems perhaps counterintuitive because that would disrupt network structure if you make adhesion molecules into paracrine factors but perhaps that's part of the plasticity in networks. "Cell adhesion molecules and diffusible growth factors have long been studied as two separate forms of intercellular communication. However, biologists working in these two areas are seeing their fields converge. This merge has been promoted by the identification of membrane-anchored growth factors that activate receptors on adjacent cells through intimate cell-cell contacts, and cell adhesion molecules that act as signaling receptors." "The realization that despite their differences, membrane-anchored growth factors and Intercellular adhesion molecules are part of a general strategy for cell-cell communication" [Bosenberg 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0955-0674(93)90032-L)

How could adhesion affect paracrine communication/hormone release?
- By forming a diffusion barrier [Wilfinger 1984](https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-8166(84)90026-0). But note that this is controversial. Could limit diffusion of paracrine factors (evidence [Krisch 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00214248)) but also e.g. hypothalamic factors from the blood. Evidence against the diffusion barrier theory in FS cells where tight junctions are leaky [Allaerts 1989](https://doi.org/10.1159/000125146), [Allaerts 1990](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-127-3-1517)
- Tight junctions may "direct the secretory product toward the capillaries or extravascular spaces" [Abraham 1979](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00236078)
- "the opening and closing of a junctional network could affect the rate at which hormone is released into the perivascular space" [Wilfinger 1984](https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-8166(84)90026-0)
- "These effects may be the result of hypertrophic prolactin cells completely surrounding the gonadotropic cells and isolating them from releasing factors, thereby reducinig gonadotropic secretion." [Nakane 1970](https://doi.org/10.1177/18.1.9) (this refers to the cup-shaped lactotrophs surrounding gonadotrophs and blocking access of factors to the gonadotrophs, presumably)

Evidence that adhesion also affects hormone output
- Inhibiting N-cadherin binding by antibody decreases GH secretion from fetal pituitary cells [Rubinek 2003](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2003-030090)
- Correlative observation from teleost pituitaries: membrane regions that have "stomata" i.e. probable sites of vesicle exocytosis also often have clusters of tight junctions [Abraham 1979](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00236078)
- The response of lactotrophs to cholinomimetic carbachol is dependent on cell-cell contact [Carmeliet 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(89)90088-9)
- Angiotensin II induces GH release in aggregates but not in dispersed cells [Robberecht 1988](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-122-4-1496)
- Beta-adrenergic stimulation of GH release is weaker in dispersed cells than in intact tissue [Abraham 1998](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-117-5-1818)

Evidence for importance of adhesion for something other than hormone output
- Most papers studying paracrine communication have focused on effects on hormone production. But shouldn't it be important to investigate other consequences e.g. cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, migration etc.?
- Has been proposed that corticotroph physical network acts as a scaffold for development of gonadotrophs/other cell types [Budry 2011](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1105929108)
- Could also direct/regulate diffusion of paracrine factors [Krisch 1984](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00214248)
- "Changes in cell-cell adhesion contacts could conceivably affect hormonal gene expression (or other stuff) by determining which cell type becomes the target cell's neighbor" Lail-Trecker dissertation
- The physical networks form like the prerequisite/foundation for rest of the communication i.e. the networks are the "blueprints"
- Tight junctions may partition things in the membrane e.g. ion channels and thereby regulate ion transport which is crucial for hormone release [Schwartz 1994](in papers folder)
- Cell proliferation: overexpressing E-cadherin in GH3 cells decreased cell proliferation [Heinrich 1999, thesis](https://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/304500898/55707D1B189E4D7APQ/4?accountid=10673)

Evidence that we need to account for pituitary context when evaluating pituitary cell activity: [[Regionality in the pituitary#Evidence that pituitary cell function is gland location-dependent]]

We need to consider the role of the ECM in regulating paracrine interactions/pituitary cell function/other
- "The extracellular matrix has a critical role in signal dispersion [...] One such mechanism is based on the extracellular matrix (ECM), whose constituent proteoglycans are proposed to sculpt the concentration gradients by binding to signaling proteins, co-receptors and other proteins that are involved in controlling the dispersion of signals [...] In the ECM-dependent model, however, *release of TGF-β from the producing cells is of secondary importance to its liberation from the ECM*, and binding sites in the ECM are a consequence of a random walk after release from the producing cell." [Roy 2014](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201400122)
- "Prl secretion from cells cultured on extracellular matrix is twice as great as from cells cultured on plastic" [Elias 1990](https://doi.org/10.1089/dna.1990.9.369)
- Only in the presence of ECM do cells respond to TRH [Spira 1983](https://doi.org/10.1530/acta.0.1040279)
- More PRL, FSH and LH release from cells culture on ECM [Horacek 1992](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.1041510123)
- [Mendoza-Garrido 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736574804000280) suggest that the different types of collagen in the pituitary generate "migratory pathways" to direct where the pituitary cells move during development/reorganisation
- "Cell–matrix interactions undoubtedly have a role in the development and maintenance of the complex nonrandom structure of the human pituitary gland" [Murray 1997](https://doi.org/10.1007/s004280050107)

How paracrine might affect adhesion
- Alter expression/affinity of CAMs and therefore regulate network structure

There could be synergy between adhesion and paracrine signalling
- E.g. Wnts/b-catenin are important both for adhesion and signalling so the paths cross, see good description in [Gumbiner 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81279-9)

Evidence that juxtacrine/gap junction communication dominates over paracrine for PRL transcription [Momiji 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007030)
