Try subclustering clusters based on their CAM properties to try and identify cells that connect homotypically vs ones that are in heterotypic contact. Paul’s idea that cells turn off CAMs when in homotypic contact and then switch when in heterotypic contact

Could paracrine factor expression patterns teach us something about pituitary cell type lineages? Developmental potential? Bc their expression is developmentally regulated (see [[ICN2022]]) and the expression varies with cell type during development (vs adulthood). [Cimini 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0736-5748(03)00072-8) argue that since the vascular connection between the pituitary and hypothalamus form after the pituitary cell types appear at E15 and later, that hypothalamic factors are unlikely to determine pituitary cell type specification: "This gives credence to a possible neuropeptide involvement in a primitive feedback mechanism of autonomous control of pituitary secretory activity, until vascular connections develop and later allow the hypothalamic–pituitary axis to activate repertoires of transcription factors that determine histodifferentiation of pituitary cell types."
It is a bit weird that some factors have inverse expression patterns during development and adulthood? E.g. Wnt4 KOs have fewer cells expressing GH, TSHb, CGA but normal numbers of POMC cells [Potok 2008](https://doi.org/10.1002/dvdy.21511)
Or could the paracrine factors act in adulthood like weights that balance the abundance of the different cell types? Maybe that's why they pop up in different cell types? So if e.g. factor A stimulates proliferation it will pop up in the necessary cell type to promote balanced abundance?

Is the common feature of aging the inability to sustain function during a challenge? As in at basal/low challenge the function is preserved but upon a major challenge the system breaks down. This is what [Almaca 2014](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1414053111) found: beta cell function is maintained in old islets but not when there is a major challenge
