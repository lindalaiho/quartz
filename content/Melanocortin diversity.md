N-acetylated a-MSH can recruit lactotrophs but des-acetyl a-MSH had no such activity [Ellerkmann 1992](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/131/2/566/2496231), so it is not just receptors that have various responses (although that is certainly ultimately responsible for the above effect) but slight modifications also appears to affect receptor activity. But how consistent is this with in vitro studies showing that acetyl a-MSH and des-acetyl a-MSH have similar/different effects on e.g. MC4 signalling?

For many years there have been reports of a-MSH and desacetyl-a-MSH having different effects/potency despite them not having big differences in binding affinities at the MCRs [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978105004596#bib134). Mostly this has been put down to a-MSH being more stable. But could heterodimerization and biased signalling explain parts of this?
