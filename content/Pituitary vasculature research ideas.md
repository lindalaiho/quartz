What happens to the number of pericytes upon physiological challenge? Bc the number declines in the pancreas in type 2 diabetes [Almaca 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2018.02.016. Might it be that older pituitaries have fewer pericytes and this is why the capillaries are dilated?

Does pituitary angiotensin II affect the vasculature? It is highly expressed in gonadotrophs

Using the aging database it should be possible to calculate metrics like in figure 1 in [Almaca 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2018.02.016) (what % of capillaries pericytes cover, what the ratio is for pericyte:endothelial in young vs old mice pituitaries)

We can test Ca responses of pericytes to various substances by using GCamp indicators under NG2 promoter as done in [Almaca 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2018.02.016)
