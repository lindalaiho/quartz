### Bet hedging: a pre-existing diversity of cell states allows *rapid* population adaptation to a new environment [Dueck 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201500124)
Essentially, if you have lots of variety, the probability is higher that a part of the population is able to "match" the new environment and survive/thrive
- Most evidence for this comes from bacterial populations where a portion of the population remains in a quiescent state which is a good defense against antibiotics that target replication
- There is little evidence in mammals but cancer cells have been proposed to exhibit this property (cancer "stem cells")
- More broadly, having more variability might be good when you are exposed to a wide variety of "environments", e.g. immune cells and antigens

### Creates graded responses [Dueck 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201500124)
If all cells responded stimultanously and in the same way, you would only get all-or-none responses. In many systems, including the pituitary, it would be beneficial to produce responses of variable strength e.g. tuning how much hormone to produce by having variable proportions of a cell type produce vs not produce a hormone.

### Creates fate plasticity [Dueck 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201500124)
If you have lots of variability in gene expression, there is an increased probability that the expression level exceeds the threshold required for a fate transition
- This might be more relevant for progenitor cells
- But not excluding relevance to [[Multipotential pituitary cells]] and the theory that aging might produce more transcriptional nose/heterogeneity which might account for the [[Decreased stability of gene expression is a feature of pituitary aging|increased number of multihormonal cells in old pituitaries]]

### Heterogeneity increases information content [Dueck 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201500124)
- Prime example: medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) randomly express tissue-restricted genes to train developing T cells to recognise 'self'

### Create a two-tiered information system that coordinates population behaviours [Dueck 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201500124)
There are many examples of "first responder" cells in a population that have features that none of the other cells have and they play a role in coordinating the total response of the population
