"Some early quite indirect evidence suggested that dimerization can play a role in melanocortin receptor activation as chemical cross-linking of a peptide antagonist for the melanocortin receptor with a linker forming a dimer potentially able to bridge a receptor pair yielded a melanocortin receptor agonist" [This paper](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1074552196901441)"

Could summarize evidence that suggest MCRs homo/heterodimerize: (1) BRET/FRET/CO-IP (2) bivalent ligands (3) evidence for interacting binding sites/other indirect evidence

Maybe point out that homodimers form at receptor levels below endogenous so not an overexpression artifact AND BRET levels similar despite varying receptor expression levels https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0006291X0402604X?via%3Dihub

"From a rigorous biochemical point of view, a given GPCR conformation is due to the constraints imposed by the local context, in general terms by the lipid bilayer and, in a more specific way, by direct molecular interactions with diverse proteins."
           
If the ligand affinity for a MCR is similar then surely the relative abundance of the ligands plays a bigger role in determining effects i.e. processing is imp <- this is a FAIR POINT

Theories on why MCR affinities are so diff: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648006000736?via%3Dihub#bib1 (also good evidence for where each MCR is expressed)

 Interaction between the different components, whether direct heterodimerisation or downstream or indirect e.g. MC3 and MC4 might not directly associate but both interact with MRAPs so larger oligomers could be possible
 
 Ghrelin cannot induce feeding in MC3 KO mice like it does in WT mice -> MC3, not just MC4, mediate effects of ghrelin. Possibility for heterodimerisation to have significance but also just MC3
 
 "Heterodimerization of GPCRs can result in a structural and functional unit that is completely different to homodimeric or monomeric GPCRs."

"[Pharmacological profiles of oligomerized μ-opioid receptors](https://www.mdpi.com/58894)" are very different
 
 Is there high functional redundancy in melancortin signalling? If so, why?
 
 "Classically, chemokine receptors and other GPCRs have been thought to function as monomers and have been studied as isolated systems to identify particular pathways activated by a given ligand/receptor. However, although GPCRs may activate G proteins as monomers [9 – 11], they are also known to homo- and heterodimerize. Furthermore, they can engage in direct and indirect crosstalk with other signaling receptors." "and that the efficacy of drugs directed against these receptors may be highly dependent on the interactome state of the receptor" "Transinhibition (or transinactivation) is an important component of crosstalk that can influence receptor signaling and sometimes account for deviations in expected cell responses" "Although signaling pathways activated by a particular ligand-receptor interaction have classically been described and depicted in a linear manner, it is clear that there are often deviations from this type of clear-cut relationship. Transactivation, the ability of one receptor to evoke the signaling response of another receptor, is one type of mechanism responsible for such deviations" "Additionally, chemokine receptors may be *exploited* by other networks, completely independent of chemokine involvement." https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-008-8666-1
 
 That the paper showing MC1 and MC3 already form dimers intracellularly means that the issue that bivalent ligands may crosslink receptors that wouldn't form natively is not so converning (see evidence from above chemokine paper that cross-linking agents might cause problems). Also that ligand binding does not seem to alter formation of MCR dimers.
 
 Complex interactions between proteins can give rise to receptors with emergent properties
 
 "many GPCR heteromers have distinct functional properties compared to their corresponding homomers" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355952/
 
 Potential mechanisms underlying crosstalk https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355952/:
 - Heteromers
 - Competition for a shared pool of G proteins
 - Crossactivation of signalling pathways ("signalling integration")

"Although GPCRs are typically considered as detectors for first messengers in classical signal transduction pathways, they seldom operate in isolation in complex biological systems." https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00428/full

Key Q is whether any of the MCR heterodimers have any physiological significance bc some for MC3-GHSR but no functional evidence for the dimers within the MCR family

"perhaps the most important questions in terms of relevance of GPCR heterodimers relate to whether they generate **novel receptors** in terms of either ligand pharmacology or function."

"The heterodimer is only one type of heteromeric complex and the evidence is equally compatible with the existence of higher order heteromeric complexes, where also adapter proteins such as homer proteins and scaffolding proteins can exist, assisting in the process of linking the GPCR and ion channel receptors together in a receptor mosaic that may have special integrative value and may constitute the molecular basis for learning and memory" say this after describing GPCR heterodimers in that notable that most of these GPCRs can also interact with MRAPs, raising the possibility of complex higher order oligomers

"This has led many scientists to describe ‘phenotypic’ analysis of GPCR activity, which takes into account the endogenous receptor environment. Researchers now recognize the importance of receptor expression level, the G proteins that are present, the ratio between G proteins and their receptors, and the availability of accessory proteins. Such factors can all influence the efficacy of the drugs that are tested." https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614707001563?via%3Dihub

"A number of examples of GPCRs exhibiting ‘atypical’ pharmacological profiles have been reported" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295206005752

"The realization that the putative ‘β4-adrenoceptor’ is in fact an alternative conformation of the β1-adrenoceptor gene product has been excellently reviewed elsewhere" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295206005752 OH MAN this is exactly what Joanne has been saying about a 6th MCR i.e. pharma evidence said there should be a fourth beta adrenoceptor but turns out it was another conformational state of the beta1 adrenoceptor

"Despite the failure to identify additional α1-adrenoceptor genes, significant evidence has accrued that the α1-adrenoceptor phenotype observed in numerous tissues in a wide variety of species does not correlate with any of the cloned α1-adrenoceptors." https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295206005752

"Taken together, these data suggest that the pharmacological profile of the functional α1-adrenoceptor population in a given background is sensitive to the influence of the cellular environment through an as yet poorly defined mechanism." https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295206005752 is there evidence of MCR pharmacology in purified membranes? That would indicate what happens in the absence of endogenous interacting partners? OR?

"Given that the behavior of some SNPs has been reported to vary in a cell background-dependent manner"

no evidence that MRAPs and MCRs and ohter GPCSs interact bt MRAP disrupts MC5 homodimers (?) suggesting that bigger receptor-protein complexes may form

What about was is GPR83? YES dimerises with both MC3 and GHSR https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5148169/

"As our understanding of the complexity and diversity of GPCR signaling grows, it becomes clear that the cellular environment possesses an almost unlimited repertoire of potential protein–protein (and protein–lipid) interactions, which can act in concert to shape the pharmacological profile of GPCRs expressed within it. Given this degree of complexity and the emerging view that GPCRs are capable of translating multiple extracellular signals into distinct intracellular responses and not merely acting as ‘on/off’ switches for a single linear downstream signaling cascade, it should not be at all surprising that antagonist (and in particular inverse agonist) pharmacology can be influenced by the cellular milieu." sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295206005752#bib125

"Distinct pharmacological phenotypes"

mAChR pharma properties differ depending on the tissue https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/339/1/186.short and alphaB1 adrenoceptors https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.12813

Diversity in GPCRs appears not to be achieved via alternative splicing (more than 90% of GPCRs are intronless https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952598016485) but instead via PTMs or interactions with other proteins. But in e.g. drosophila GPCRs have lots of introns

Describe known consequences of GPCR MCR dimerisation on function - anything known about trafficking? G protein coupling/biased signalling? Ligand coupling?
Nothing known for homodimers right?

Question is whether the receptors 'cluster' together into larger oligomeric complexes. This is notoriously something that hasn't been studied much (bc it's hard)

"superstructures" (https://www.cell.com/trends/biochemical-sciences/fulltext/S0968-0004(03)00065-3?code=cell-site)

So if MCR dimers are formed in ER as has been suggested then could the function be to allow only properly formed receptors to reach the surface? So, a quality control mechanism as suggested here? https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.42.091701.082314 maybe say that for other GPCRs which form dimers in ER, this has been shown to be important for proper export of GPCRs. What about the reports that MCRs are often intracellular/lowly expr at surface? Wasn't there some evidence for MC4 for this? Dimerisation with mutant prevented surface expr?
"A role for dimerization in quality control and ER export does not exclude additional functional consequences for the oligomerization process"

"An obvious possible implication is that dimerization between known receptor isoforms could be responsible for the generation of pharmacologically defined receptor subtypes for which no gene has been identified so far." "expansion of the diversity by *combinatorial arrangements of pre-existing units* is a common theme in biology and may become particularly important for GPCRs now that we know not many more than 600 genes encode for hormone and neurotransmitter receptors" https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.42.091701.082314

"In these papers, we have therefore introduced the concept of the **receptor mosaic** (RM), meaning that one can produce markedly different molecular aggregates of receptors by putting together the same building blocks to construct functionally different assemblies" https://link.springer.com/article/10.1385%2FJMN%3A26%3A2-3%3A193. so individual proteins as building blocks to make larger units with unique properties

More discussion of mosaics https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017307002901

"It seems likely that the receptor can assume not only two conformations related to two functional states: active (R*) versus inactive (R) receptor, but rather several slightly different conformations. In fact, proteins can assume a large number of slightly different structures each of which with potentially different biochemical characteristics." https://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/55/3/509.full

"GPCRs are not isolated proteins but linked with other components of the membrane" https://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/55/3/509.full and "intramembrane interactions" "broad conformational spectrum (of GPCRs)"

"Therefore, activation of one receptor would lead to different cell responses depending upon the nature of the mosaic where the receptor is located." https://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/55/3/509.full

Note to Joanne: if the MCRs participate in dimers and knockouts sometimes only delete part of the gene, could they still be expressed in part even if not functional and that way influence MCR function, could this explain some of the weird phenotypes of MCR KOs?

"The extent of human MC1-MC3 heterodimerization is unaffected by ligand binding, suggesting that the dimers may be constitutive (Mandrika _et al._, 2005)"
