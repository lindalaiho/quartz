POMC conditional cadherin knockouts have similar corticotrophs as controls as P1 but at P30 the cells were abnormally distributed throughout the gland and showed abnormal POMC expression, suggesting that adherens junctions are not needed during development but do play an important part in the migration/localisation of corticotrophs and for normal gene expression (and therefore function). The adrenal gland is normal in these knockouts despite corticotrophs being disrupted. Does this suggest that these changes in corticotrophs are not important OR could it be that they might instead have important effects within the pituitary gland on other cell types which then leads to major effects (however, in this paper there didn't appear to be overt changes in any of the other cell types)? Perhaps we should not always only be looking for obvious effects (e.g. adrenal effects) but for other ways in which the deficiency might manifest. Also note that there was no change in b-catenin mRNA in the knockouts, yet protein staining was significantly reduced... INTERESTING that b-catenin is imp both for adherens junctions and Wnt signalling - a reduction in one could lead to a reduction in the other. So one conclusion is that contact between corticotrophs is more imp in the adult than in the embryo (or there might just be another molecule that they use to connect).
