[Almaca 2014](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1414053111) found that blood flow is faster and more turbulent in larger vessels of pancreatic islets transplanted into mouse irises which they say would diminish the efficiency of transcapillary exchange -> is this what happens in the pituitary with aging?

### Fluid flow itself might be a regulator of pituitary hormone secretion [Stachura 1990](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02624090)
- **Initial observation**: GH3 cells in plate culture secrete GH and PRL (RIA) first at a stable rate which then decreases. For GH3 cells in perifusion, GH and PRL secretion is first stable, then however the rate increases 2 to 5-fold after 72h.
- The effect of perifusion is dose-dependent i.e. 1 vs 3 vs 5 ml/h pump rates lead to increasingly higher hormone secretion
- This effect would be consistent with a paracrine inhibitory signal secreted from GH3 cells that inhibits further hormone secretion
	- In a serial setup (below), GH and PRL secretion from column C was lower than for B (you get C by subtracting A's output from B+C's output)
	- When using trypsinised cells (which presumably disrupts membrane receptors) in column C and "normal" cells in column B, there was no reduced hormone secretion from C (so the GH3 cells in C supposedly were no longer sensitive to the inhibitory factors from B)
	- The increase in DNA content was not big enough to account for the increased secretion at higher flow rates and nutrient exhaustion was also ruled out as an explanation
