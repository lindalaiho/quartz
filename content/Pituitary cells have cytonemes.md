Evidence that corticotroph protrusions mediate paracrine signalling [Paden 2006](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2005-0715): "The occasional synaptic-like contacts that we observed between corticotroph processes containing GAP-43 and other gland cells suggests that these processes are involved in intercellular communication within the AP and are not simply sites of hormone release into the vasculature." note that these processes also appear to form between the corticotrophs themselves. But why would we need to form these if they form networks just via cell body contact/gap junctions? They would presumably have some clear paracrine function
