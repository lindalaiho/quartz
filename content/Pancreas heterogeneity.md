Microtubule stability in beta cells is heterogeneous. Cells with very stable microtubules have lower insulin secretion. Microtubule destabilisation recruits dormant beta cells. Microtubules tune insulin secretion to ensure coordinated release. [Trodgen 2021](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59912)

The pancreas has great heterogeneity in oxygenation of islets where a subpopulation of islets (20-25%) might act as a functional reserve of beta cells. These cells also have low protein biosynthesis (low H3-leucine incorporation). When you decrease islet mass to 40-50% by partial pancreatectomy those low-oxygen islets disappear (are recruited?). The authors speculated that the low oxygen is due to low blood flow/vasoconstriction. They used an interesting technique where 2-nitroimidazole pimonidazole only accumulates in cells where oxygen tension is under 10 mmHg. [Olsson 2011](https://doi.org/10.2337/db09-0877)

In human pancreas tissue slices incubated ex vivo with norepinephrine, [[Pancreatic pericytes]] at the periphery of the islet responded with increased iCa (measured by membrane-permeable Ca indicator Fluo4) but pericytes in the centre did not [Goncalves 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.602519)
