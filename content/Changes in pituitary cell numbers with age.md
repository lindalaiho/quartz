[[Why do pituitary cell numbers change with age]]

### Lactotrophs
- Lots of lactotroph tumours with age [Shinkai 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-6374(95)01614-6)
- Lactotroph numbers (not including lactotsomatotrophs) increase steadily with age in female wistar rats from 3 months old to 27 months [Shinkai 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-6374(95)01614-6)

### Somatotrophs
- Somatotrophs (not including lactosomatotrophs) increase in number from 3 to 12 months of age in female wistar rats but then decrease with age to 27 months [Shinkai 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-6374(95)01614-6)

### Corticotrophs
- The number of ACTH-immunopositive cells decreased with age in rats 1-12 months of age and correlated inversely with the number of S100-immunopositive cells [Kapitonova 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24640738/)
- [Pavlovic 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-020-00583-7) found increased ACTH volume density in the pituitaries of aging humans 44-89 years old but it's not clear whether this is increased number and/or size of corticotrophs

### Multihormonal cells
- Lactosomatotrophs increase in number 5-10 fold from 12 months to 27 months of age in female wistar rats [Shinkai 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-6374(95)01614-6)

### FS cells
- 24-month-old rats reportedly have numerous FS cells with projections that go in all directions and the projections had many ramifications [Shirasawa 1983](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00222177)
