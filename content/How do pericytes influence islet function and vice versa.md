- Methods: optogenetic activation of pericytes in islets transplanted into the iris
- Results:
	- Activation reduced diameter of 30% of capillaries to the extent of 20-50% reduction
	- Activation reduced blood flow in 80% of capillaries
	- Activation reduced diffusion of fluorescent glucose into the parenchyma
	- Activation increased insulin and glucagon secretion
	- Activation produced the opposite-to-normal response to glucose challenge i.e. reduced insulin and increased glucagon

- Adenosine released by beta cells inhibit Ca responses in pericytes, preventing their contraction and therefore causing vasodilation (shown using adenosine receptor antagonist) and increased blood flow
