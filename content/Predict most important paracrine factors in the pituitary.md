The most highly connected proteins in the cell are the most important for its survival [Jeong 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35075138)

Could we therefore predict which paracrine factors are likely to be most important by looking at which one(s) interact with the most other proteins?

Alternatively, determine all paracrine factors expressed by a pituitary cell above a certain threshold and then rank them by which ones have the most interaction partners to determine which might be most important?

Problem: not all paracrine factors will be equally important in all tissues (which this approach assumes) and most paracrine factors supposedly interact with roughly the same number of receptors
