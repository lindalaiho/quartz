### Glucocorticoids have opposite effects on gene expression depending on the cellular ratio of AP-1 complex components (idea from [Noel 1991](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-129-3-1317))
- GCs ehanced expression of proliferin in the presence of c-Jun whereas they inhibited expression in the presence of c-Fos and c-Jun (all acting on a proliferin glucocorticoid response element) [Diamond 1990](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.2119054)

### Key question: do glucocorticoids regulate PC2 and are AP-1 complex components involved?
