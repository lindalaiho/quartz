"Ultimately, the goal of scRNA-seq should not be to simply define replicable profiles across more and more data modalities, but rather to understand why they are replicable." [Crow 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2018.12.002)

The subtypes correspond to cells in distinct locations in the pituitary. It might be that the microenvironment induces expression of certain genes and these are the subtype markers. Alternatively the geographic location determines whether the cell has access to hypothalamic/peripheral factors. Could be tested by examining distribution of markers (several) in the pituitary and confirming that they co-localise with ACTH.
