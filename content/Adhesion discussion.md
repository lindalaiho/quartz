"Although these adhesive contacts are generally stable, they should not be regarded as static, and in many cases the maintenance of stable connections requires active  cellular processes." [Gumbiner 1996](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)81279-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867400812799%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

Lail-Trecker shows evidence that E-cadherin is expressed in mouse embryo but not in adult anterior pituitary which expressed N-cadherin p. 97

Problem with monolayer culture is that it does not consider tissue context: "Indeed, GH cells, LH cells, TSH cells, and ACTH cells were not often found in contact with other cells of the same type" [Morand 1996](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/137/8/3356/3037707?login=true)

Lactotrophs in contact with other lactotrophs show reduced Prl mRNA compared to single lactotrophs or lactotrophs in contact with other cells [Abraham 1996](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/137/9/4050/2498692). However, this is in contrast to many studies showing increased PRL by cell-cell adhesion (see [Spangler 1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199801)174:1%3C115::AID-JCP13%3E3.0.CO;2-E?casa_token=N7i_IuWURlIAAAAA:htoj0Bl9tgMAih1_AHPIHWaLOml8PmOefUbnmkZqfwByL6UzGG-MIJSHYG3L1WDy9mFS0BhsZeIUNQ) introduction)

### Cytonemes might be involved in network formation
"To form and modify such elaborate networks, dynamic cellular extensions may be important. Growing extensions may recognize the correct cell to connect to, and either form a permanent connection, or maintain the contact while the connected cells migrate toward each other to form clusters with soma-soma contacts. While these events are still hypothetical, several lines of evidence support their occurrence, some of them presented below."
