### Castration
- In castrated albino rats, there is more blood in the "vascular channels" of the pituitary i.e. an increased blood vessel diameter (which may be a reason for the increased weight of the gland) [Addison 1917](https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.900280207)
- "In castrated animals, the blood vessels were well developed in the anterior pituitary gland" (and it was especially FS cells that increased in cell size and number after castration and they made more contact with blood vessels??) [Inoue 1999](https://doi.org/10.1679/aohc.62.205)
- In castrated rats, pericytes extended more long projections to nearby capillaries [Jindatip 2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-012-0144-z)
- The number of pericytes increased with increasing time since castration (1, 2, 4 weeks), they became more desmin-immunopositive, had a larger cytoplasmic volume, more developed Golgi and many vesicles in the cytoplasm, enlarged RER (all indicating hyperfunction). If I interpret the meaning of the authors correctly, after castration the number of pericytes that are detached from capillaries increased (but small processes still remained attached to the vessels). Is it possible that these pericytes are changing into some other type of cell? [Jindatip 2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-012-0144-z)
- The proportions of the different types of pericytes (see [[Pituitary pericytes#^a74a85]]) shifts after castration: less oval, more elongate, more of the last 2 but only after prolonged time (4wk) [Jindatip 2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-012-0144-z)
- No effect of castration on portal blood flow in male rats [Eckland 1987](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.113R001)
- In male rats, castration resulted in "marked hyperemia (increased blood flow)" of the AP after 20 days. This could be reversed with testosterone propionate treatment if given before 20 days post-castration but if treatment was delayed until 70 days it was not as effective. Despite increased blood flow, there was no change in rate of oxygen consumption. [Levey 1957](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplegacy.1957.189.1.86)


### Undernutrition
- Young rats held at maintenance weight by limiting their food intake showed a "striking increase in the vascularity", adult rats showed an even more "conspicuous" increase in vascularity. The authors note that the increase "is due chiefly to a distention of the blood-vessels, giving the sections a markedly hyperemic appearance". The changes are at least partially reversed after refeeding. [Jackson 1917](https://ia600708.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/28/items/crossref-pre-1923-scholarly-works/10.1002%252Faja.1000090101.zip&file=10.1002%252Faja.1000210204.pdf)

### Cold exposure
- Within a few hours of cold exposure, rat anterior lobes show increased vascularity (dilated vessels that also contain globular material) [Bailliff 1938](https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1000620404) -> actually this is interesting since cold usually constricts blood vessels, another case of the pituitary responding differently than other organs?

*"This figure shows early dilation of sinuses in response to stimulation. Note that the cells are drawn out into stellate shapes by the dilation process.  Animal exposed 18 hours at -3°C. X700."* [Bailliff 1938](https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1000620404)

### Metamorphosis
- Increased vascularity of the anterior lobe in the frog during metamorphosis (rana pipiens) [D'Angelo 1941](https://doi.org/10.1002/aja.1000690304)

### Adrenalectomy
- In ADX, adult female rat pituitary "vasculatures were also increased in number and their diameter was dilated" [Itoh 2003](https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.10261)
- No effect on portal blood flow in male rats [Eckland 1987](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.113R001)

### Oestrogen administration
- Upon i.m. oestrogen (oestradiol dipropionate) injections (5mg), pituitary "vasculatures were increased in number and shape. It is well known that the prolonged administration of estrogen results in the “blood leaks,” actually markedly dilated and congested capillaries." [Itoh 2003](https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.10261)
- In pituitaries of female rats treated with oestradiol propionate i.m. 5mg, microvessels show irregular branching, crosslinking, strange shapes (this was somewhat reduced with bromocriptine treatment s.c. 4 days before death??), endothelial cells became irregular in shape (again somewhat reversed with bromocriptine) [Itoh 2001](https://journals.lww.com/appliedimmunohist/Fulltext/2001/12000/Three_Dimensional_Imaging_of_Hormone_Secreting.13.aspx) ^c982ea
- Rats with oestrogen-induced prolactinomas acquire a direct arterial blood supply to the AP [Elias 1984](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.81.14.4549) ^68d1fd
	- In normal rats, the AP does not receive a direct arterial blood supply: radioactive microspheres (29-35 µm in diameter) injected into the carotid artery do not reach the AP (they are too large to pass through the small portal vessels) (but are found in the posterior pituitary and the ME) [Goldman 1962](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-71-6-857)
	- In OVX female rats given E2 implants, the AP now receives arterial blood directly (bc microspheres do accumulate in the lobe, also confirmed by making vascular casts). The E2 treatment leads to PRL secreting tumours and the authors suggest that this is due to the low DA concentration in arterial blood which is unable to suppress lactotroph proliferation. This is mostly based on correlational evidence: F344 rats which are more sensitive to E2 (develop more lactotroph tumours) also show higher accumulation of microspheres, suggesting higher direct arterial input. [Elias 1984](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.81.14.4549)
	- Bromocriptine can almost fully reverse the effects of E2 on arterial blood supply formation: giving bromocriptine in pellets alongside E2 implants led to less microsphere accumulation in the pituitary, suggesting less arterial input. [Elias 1987](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-120-2-617)

### Development
- P5 (and P10) rats have pituitary vasculature with larger capillary lumens and more pericytes per capillary compared to P20 and P30, they also change from a more "active" to less active phenotype [Jindatip 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12565-013-0180-3)

### Cancer
- Prolactinomas
	- Vascular characteristics in rats [Jindatip 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00795-018-0180-4):
		- Frequent disruption of blood vessels with RBC leakage
		- Increased diameter of capillary lumens, more vessel branching
		- Pericytes: increased in number, irregular and active appearance (shrunken and curved cell bodies and nuclei, expanded cytoplasm and cellular projections), more pericyte migration, less expression of col1a1 and col3a1, more lysosomes (indicating phagocytic activity?) ^52e04b

### Endocrine disruption
- BPA treatment in rats during pregnancy led to altered vasculature in P1 pup pituitaries [Sanannam 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222312667)
	- Pericytes: decrease in number and intensity of NG2 staining ^16b992

### Hypothalamic deafferentiation
- Complete (but not rostral) deafferentiation of the mediobasal hypothalamus in female rats produced an 80% increase in blood flow (using radioactive indicators) of the anterior lobe (but note that this also included ME) compared to controls. After complete deafferentiation, AP weight also fell by 30%. No changes in blood flow of pineal, thyroid or adrenal glands following the procedure. [Nikitovitch-Winer 1986](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-118-3-1166)
	- Why? Messing with the hypothalamus may have led to the loss of regulatory influences needed to keep blood flow sufficiently low (loss of vasomotor tone?). It's also possible that deafferentiation put pressure on the AP and this led to induction of a direct arterial blood supply to the gland (as happens with [[Evidence that pituitary vasculature is targeted by challenge#^68d1fd|E2 treatment]])
	- Note: this result should be kept in mind when interpreting any results of hypothalamic ablation!

### Hypothyroidism
- Induction of hypothyroidism in male rats using propylthiouracil (PTU) produced an increased plasma flow in the portal vessels (max effect after 3 days: 140% increase) and "to the naked eye" increase vascularity of the AP. This was due to hypothyroidism specificially, not just PTU bc giving PTU + T3 (to prevent hypothyroidism development), led to no change in blood flow. [Eckland 1987](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.113R001)
	- The authors note that it is interesting that no change in portal TRH was seen in hypothyroidism [Ching 1983](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03347614) and [Rondeel 1988](https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-123-1-523) so it may be that the increased blood flow increases the presentation of TRH to AP cells and this is responsible for increased TSH secretion (rather than any increase in any absolute TRH concentration) [Eckland 1987](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.113R001)
- Human patients with hypothyroidism have distended capillaries in the AP [Boyce 1892](https://ia600708.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/22/items/crossref-pre-1909-scholarly-works/10.1002%252Fmmnd.18950400305.zip&file=10.1002%252Fpath.1700010209.pdf)
- CT scans of humans with hypothyroidism show abnormal increases in pituitary density after i.v. contrast injection and the extent of increase correlated with their serum TSH concentration. "We suggest that this enhancement reflects increased pituitary circulation associated with augmented function of the thyrotrophs" [Katevuo 1985](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2265.1985.tb02997.x)
- Hypothyroidism induced by thiouracil or PTU treatment produced a hyperaemic appearance of the AP in male rats and increase the rate of oxygen consumption of the gland [Levey 1957](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplegacy.1957.189.1.86)

### Thyroidectomy
- In male rats, thyroidectomy produced hyperemia (increased blood flow) and increased rate of oxygen consumption in the AP after 25 days. Multiple s.c. injections of T4 or T3 were fairly good at restoring the parameters to normal. [Levey 1957](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplegacy.1957.189.1.86)
